Proteins are essential components of life and key to the functionality of living organisms. \cite{ref} \\
They are composed of a sequence of amino acids, a chain of amino acids, that fold into a three-dimensional structure that determines their function. 
The study of proteins is crucial for understanding the molecular basis of life and for the development of new drugs.\\
The determination of the three-dimensional structure of a protein is a fundamental step in the study of its function.
Among the main functions of proteins are:\cite{ref}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Enzymatic catalysis}: Enzymatic proteins accelerate chemical reactions by reducing activation energy and regulating cellular metabolic processes.
    \item \textbf{Structural roles}: Some proteins, such as collagen or keratin, provide mechanical support and structural integrity to tissues.
    \item \textbf{Transport}: Molecules like hemoglobin facilitate oxygen transport, while other proteins transport nutrients and ions across cellular membranes.
    \item \textbf{Regulation and signaling}: Proteins play key roles in cellular signal transduction and the regulation of gene expression.
\end{itemize}
Our goal is to study the interactions between the amino acids that compose the protein, 
in order to understand how they fold into a functional structure.

\newpage
\section{Structure of amino acids}
\noindent Each amino acid consists of a central carbon atom (\(\alpha\)-carbon) bonded to four groups:\cite{ref2} \\
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Amino Group (\(-NH_2\))}: A basic functional group.
    \item \textbf{Carboxyl Group (\(-COOH\))}: An acidic functional group.
    \item \textbf{Side Chain (\(R\)-Group)}: This varies for each amino acid, giving it unique properties.
    \item \textbf{Hydrogen Atom}: A single hydrogen atom completes the structure.
\end{itemize}

The \(R\)-group, or side chain, determines the chemical properties of the amino acid, such as whether it is hydrophilic, hydrophobic, acidic, or basic.

\end{figure}

\section*{Conclusioni}
Per dimostrare l'allostericità nella proteina PDZ, è necessario applicare perturbazioni nelle seguenti eliche:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\alpha$A-helix (V40, A46).  
    \item $\alpha$B lower-loop (V61, L66, A69, T81).  
    \item $\alpha$C-helix (Y397, E401, A402).  
\end{itemize}

Le risposte dinamiche e strutturali attese si manifesteranno principalmente nella **tasca di legame** (α1-helix, β2-strand, CBL), nel **core $\beta$** e nelle altre regioni elicoidali. Questo approccio permette di evidenziare la \textit{rete allosterica funzionale} e separare i segnali allosterici da risposte spurie.


\section{Protein structure}
\noindent The scructure of the protein is important because it determines its function. 
The structure of a protein is divided into four levels:\cite{ref4}
\subsection{Primary structure}
\noindent The primary structure refers to the linear sequence of amino acids in a protein chain, held together by peptide bonds. This sequence is unique for each protein and dictates the higher levels of structure.

\subsection{Secondary structure}
\noindent The secondary structure refers to the local folding of the protein chain into regular patterns such as alpha-helices and beta-pleated sheets. These structures are stabilized by hydrogen bonds between the backbone atoms of the amino acids.

\subsection{Tertiary structure}
\noindent The tertiary structure describes the three-dimensional folding of the entire protein molecule, including all its side chains. This level of structure is stabilized by interactions such as hydrogen bonds, ionic bonds, hydrophobic interactions, and disulfide bridges.

\subsection{Quaternary structure}
\noindent The quaternary structure applies to proteins that consist of more than one polypeptide chain. It describes how these chains are arranged and interact with each other to form the functional protein complex.
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{/Users/enrico/PROTEINS/tesi/immagini_tesi_ingelse/71225d815cafcc09102504abdf4e10927283be98.png}
    \caption{Structures}
\end{figure}

This structure are due to the interactions between the amino acids that compose the protein. 
Following we will see our model for the interaction between the amino acids.
\newpage
\section{Allostericity}
\noindent Allostericity, from the Greek \textit{allos} (other) and \textit{stereos} (structure), is the phenomenon of the change of the protein structure by the trasmission of a signal from one site to another.\cite{ref5}
It refers to a phenomenon in which the interaction of a molecule (effector) with a specific site of a protein, known as the allosteric site, induces a conformational change that influences the functional activity of another site, usually the active site. 
This avoid the protein to do various tasks in a regulated way.
Additionally allostericity does not occur through direct interactions between the two sites but rather via changes in the network of intramolecular interactions that regulate the structure and dynamics of the protein.\\
From a thermodynamic perspective, allostericity can be described as a modulation of the distribution of a protein's energy microstates. 
In other words, the interaction with an allosteric effector alters the set of available conformational states, facilitating or inhibiting access to functional configurations.\cite{ref6}

Mathematically, the phenomenon can be represented as a variation in the population of microstates \(\{s_i\}\), described by a weighted Boltzmann distribution:\cite{ref6}

\[
P(s_i) = \frac{e^{-\Delta F(s_i)/k_BT}}{\sum_j e^{-\Delta F(s_j)/k_BT}}
\]

where \(\Delta F(s_i)\) represents the free energy associated with microstate \(s_i\), \(k_B\) is the Boltzmann constant, and \(T\) is the absolute temperature.

The allosteric effect can also be quantified by considering the change in free energy associated with the effector interaction. For a protein with two principal states, \(R\) (relaxed) and \(T\) (tense), the allosteric equilibrium can be expressed in terms of an equilibrium constant:\cite{ref6}

\[
L = \frac{[T]}{[R]}
\]
where \([T]\) and \([R]\) represent the relative concentrations of the two conformational states, where the presence of an effector modifies \(L\), stabilizing one state over the other.
Therefore proteins are not rigid structures; instead, they are ensembles of conformational states that fluctuate over temporal and spatial scales.

 So allosteric effectors,  can be represented as a perturbation that modifies the energy landscape of the conformational states \(\{E_i\}\), remodeling energy pathways and altering the probability \(P_i\) of each state, where:\cite{ref6}

\[
P_i = \frac{e^{-\beta E_i}}{Z}, \quad \text{with } Z = \sum_i e^{-\beta E_i}.
\]

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{/Users/enrico/PROTEINS/tesi/immagini_tesi_ingelse/1-s2.0-S0959440X23002117-gr1.jpg}
    \caption{Schematic representation of allostericity: the interaction with an allosteric effector (site A) induces a conformational change that affects a distant site (site B).}
    \label{fig:allostericity_dynamics}
\end{figure}

This dynamic view integrates well with computational approaches such as molecular dynamics and interaction residue networks, which allow for the identification of specific pathways through which allosteric information propagates within the protein.


Understanding how and why the proteins fold into a functional structure it is useful for the study of the molecular basis of life and for the development of new drugs.
To study it we need to understand the causal mechanism and the propagation of the signal between the amino acids that compose the protein.
\newpage
\subsection{QUESTA PARTE LA METTO? LA SUA FINALITA E' FARE CAPIRE IN PRATICA AL LETTORE COSI' CHE SIA MENO ASTRATTA QUESTA PRIMA PARTE, DIMMI TU FABIO}
\subsection{Practical exemple of the mechanism of allostericity}
\noindent Hemoglobin, the oxygen-transporting protein within red blood cells, is a classic example of an allosteric protein.  \\
Its function is to bind oxygen in the lungs and release it efficiently in tissues where oxygen is needed. This process is regulated by its allosteric properties, which involve conformational changes and cooperative binding.

Hemoglobin exists in two main states:\cite{ref7}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{T-state (Tense):} This state has a lower affinity for oxygen and is stabilized in tissues where oxygen levels are low.
    \item \textbf{R-state (Relaxed):} This state has a higher affinity for oxygen and is stabilized in the oxygen-rich environment of the lungs.
\end{itemize}

When the first oxygen molecule binds to one of hemoglobin's four subunits, it induces a conformational change that increases the affinity of the remaining subunits for oxygen. 
This phenomenon is called \textit{cooperative binding} and is a hallmark of allosteric regulation.

Similarly, the release of oxygen in tissues is facilitated by other effectors, such as:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Carbon dioxide (\(CO_2\))} and \textbf{protons (\(H^+\))}, which stabilize the T-state (Bohr effect).
    \item \textbf{2,3-Bisphosphoglycerate (2,3-BPG)}, which reduces oxygen affinity to promote oxygen release in tissues.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Applications of understanding protein function}

\noindent Exploring how proteins function in dynamic ways has numerous practical uses in areas like medicine, technology, and diagnostics:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Improving health treatments:}  
    Discovering new ways to interact with specific protein sites can open doors to advanced therapies for various illnesses. For instance, it could help create medicines that manage oxygen levels in the body or develop drugs to target diseases like cancer or infections.

    \item \textbf{Designing synthetic proteins:}  
    Insights into protein behavior are used to create innovative molecules, such as artificial blood substitutes or enzymes tailored for specific industrial or medical needs.

    \item \textbf{Advancing disease detection:}  
    Certain protein characteristics make them valuable markers for identifying and tracking health conditions, from diabetes to tissue damage, offering more precise diagnostic tools.

    \item \textbf{Innovating drug development:}  
    Strategies that focus on unique protein features can enhance drug effectiveness while minimizing unintended effects, paving the way for more targeted treatments in areas like cancer and heart disease.

    \item \textbf{Enhancing oxygen delivery:}  
    Studying proteins involved in oxygen transport can lead to improved therapies for people with limited oxygen levels, whether due to medical conditions or high-performance demands.

    \item \textbf{Supporting agriculture and environment:}  
    Understanding proteins in plants and microorganisms can boost food production or aid environmental cleanup, such as by improving nutrient efficiency or reducing carbon emissions.
\end{itemize}

\section{PDZ Domain}
\noindent 
In molecular biology, a \textbf{domain} is a specific region of a protein that can perform a structural or functional role independently from the rest of the protein.\cite{ref8} \\
Domains are essential because they serve as modular units that recur and combine to form complex proteins with distinct functions.\cite{ref8} \\
Proteins often consist of multiple domains arranged in various combinations, creating multifunctional macromolecules capable of complex interactions. This domain architecture is essential for processes such as cell signaling, immune response, and metabolic regulation.\\
Moreover domains are not just structural units; they are also functional hubs that dictate the interactions and roles of proteins in cellular environments. \cite{ref8}

\subsection{Definition of Domain}
\noindent A protein domain is generally defined by three key characteristics:\cite{ref8}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{A structurally independent unit}: It is a portion of the protein that can fold into a stable three-dimensional structure on its own. This stability ensures that the domain can function even if other parts of the protein are absent or denatured. \\
    The ability of domains to independently fold is crucial for their versatility and functionality.
    \item \textbf{A functionally independent unit}: It can perform specific tasks, such as binding to a molecule or interacting with other proteins. For instance, the SH2 domain recognizes phosphorylated tyrosine residues, enabling signal transduction pathways.\\
    Some domains exhibit functional independence.
    \item \textbf{An evolutionary modular unit}: Domains are often reused in different proteins during evolution, allowing for the development of new functions. This modularity is evident in protein families where similar domains are observed across diverse organisms, reflecting a shared evolutionary origin. 
\end{enumerate}

Domains are classified based on their structure, sequence, or function, with databases such as Pfam and SMART cataloging thousands of examples.\cite{pfam} These resources are invaluable for researchers aiming to predict protein function, identify evolutionary relationships, and design novel biomolecules with tailored functionalities. Structural studies and computational analyses continue to expand our understanding of domain architectures, revealing the intricate interplay between form and function in proteins.

\subsection{The PDZ Domain}
\noindent The \textbf{PDZ domain} is a well-studied example of a protein domain. It is named after the three proteins in which it was first identified:\cite{ref8}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{P}SD-95 (Postsynaptic density protein 95),
    \item \textbf{D}lgA (Drosophila discs large protein),
    \item \textbf{Z}O-1 (Zona Occludens 1).
\end{itemize}
The PDZ domain exemplifies the modularity of protein domains, as it appears in a wide variety of proteins across eukaryotes, highlighting its evolutionary significance. PDZ domains organize and stabilize large multiprotein complexes. This prevalence underscores their critical role in maintaining cellular architecture and facilitating biochemical signaling pathways.
\subsubsection{Characteristics of the PDZ Domain}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Length}: Typically consists of 80--90 amino acids, making it a compact and efficient structural module. Despite its small size, the PDZ domain has remarkable functional versatility, binding to a diverse array of target peptides with high specificity.
    \item \textbf{Main Function}: Facilitates protein-protein interactions by recognizing specific peptide sequences, often located at the C-terminal region of target proteins. This ability to bind peptides with high specificity and affinity makes PDZ domains essential for organizing protein complexes. Such specificity arises from the conserved binding groove, which accommodates peptide motifs in a lock-and-key fashion.\cite{song1997}
    \item \textbf{Biological Role}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Assembling protein complexes at cellular membranes. For instance, PDZ domains play a pivotal role in assembling synaptic proteins, ensuring efficient signal transduction in neurons.
        \item Cellular signaling, particularly in pathways regulating cell growth and differentiation. PDZ-mediated interactions are involved in key signaling cascades, including those controlled by receptor tyrosine kinases and G-protein-coupled receptors.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Structure}: The PDZ domain has a characteristic structure composed of an antiparallel beta-sheet and two alpha-helices. This conserved fold forms a groove that interacts with the target peptide, contributing to its specificity. The structural plasticity of PDZ domains allows them to adapt to various ligands, enhancing their functional diversity.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{The PDZ Domain in the 3LNX Protein}

\noindent The 3LNX protein, on which we will work, provides a clear example of how a PDZ domain binds to a target peptide. This structure offers important insights into the functioning of these domains:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{How the peptide binds:}
    
    In the 3LNX protein, the PDZ domain has a "hydrophobic pocket" that accommodates the peptide it binds to. This binding is very precise and stable, thanks to connections such as hydrogen bonds and weak interactions between nearby molecules. Small changes in the sequence of the peptide can influence how well the PDZ domain binds.

    \item \textbf{Domain flexibility:}
    
    When the peptide binds, the PDZ domain slightly adjusts its shape. This shows that it is very flexible and capable of interacting with many different types of molecules. This flexibility is essential for its role in cellular communication.

    \item \textbf{Biological importance:}
    
    PDZ domains, like the one in the 3LNX protein, are fundamental in synapse organization, where they help assemble signaling complexes necessary for brain function. Knowledge of this protein has been used to design molecules that can regulate these interactions, with potential applications for treating diseases.
\end{enumerate}







\chapter{Modeling the Interaction between Amino Acids: GNM}
\noindent The interactions between the amino acids that compose the protein are crucial for the folding of the protein into a functional structure.  
Thus, we need a Hamiltonian to describe the system. 

If the protein is at equilibrium, we expect that the Hamiltonian is a function of a potential that depends on the position of every atom constituting the PDZ-specific domain.  
Therefore, my Hamiltonian \( H \) can be written as \( H = V(\mathbf{r}) \), where \( \mathbf{r} \) is the vector containing the positions of every atom that constitutes the protein.  

Since this is a very complex system, we cannot solve the problem exactly, so we must use an approximation. The second-order approximation of a function \( V(\mathbf{r}) \), around an equilibrium point \( \mathbf{r}_0 \), can be expressed as:\cite{ref9}

\begin{equation}
V(\mathbf{r}) \approx V(\mathbf{r}_0) + \nabla V(\mathbf{r}_0)^\top (\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r}_0) + \frac{1}{2} (\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r}_0)^\top \mathbf{H_V} (\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r}_0),\label{hessian}
\end{equation}

where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( V(\mathbf{r}_0) \) is the value of the function at the equilibrium point \( \mathbf{r}_0 \).
    \item \( \nabla V(\mathbf{r}_0) \) is the gradient of the function, defined as:
    \begin{equation}
    \nabla V(\mathbf{r}) = \frac{\partial V}{\partial \mathbf{r}} \bigg|_{\mathbf{r} = \mathbf{r}_0},
    \end{equation}
    which equals zero if \( \mathbf{r}_0 \) represents a minimum point, corresponding to the equilibrium position.
    \item \( \mathbf{H_V} \) is the \textbf{Hessian matrix} of \( V(\mathbf{r}) \), defined as:
    \begin{equation}
    \mathbf{H_V} = \frac{\partial^2 V}{\partial \mathbf{r}^2} \bigg|_{\mathbf{r} = \mathbf{r}_0},
    \end{equation}
    \[
    \mathbf{H} = \begin{bmatrix}
    \frac{\partial^2 V}{\partial x_1^2} & \frac{\partial^2 V}{\partial x_1 \partial x_2} & \cdots & \frac{\partial^2 V}{\partial x_1 \partial x_{3N}} \\
    \frac{\partial^2 V}{\partial x_2 \partial x_1} & \frac{\partial^2 V}{\partial x_2^2} & \cdots & \frac{\partial^2 V}{\partial x_2 \partial x_{3N}} \\
    \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
    \frac{\partial^2 V}{\partial x_{3N} \partial x_1} & \frac{\partial^2 V}{\partial x_{3N} \partial x_2} & \cdots & \frac{\partial^2 V}{\partial x_{3N}^2}
    \end{bmatrix}.
    \]
    It is a symmetric matrix that describes the curvature of \( V(\mathbf{r}) \) around \( \mathbf{r}_0 \).
\end{itemize}

It is important to note that the \textbf{Hessian matrix} \( \mathbf{H_V} \) should not be confused with the \textbf{Hamiltonian}, which represents the total energy of a system in terms of conjugate coordinates (positions and momenta).  

Thus, apart from constants, the Hamiltonian can be approximated as:

\begin{equation}
V(\mathbf{r}) \approx \frac{1}{2} (\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r}_0)^\top \mathbf{H_V} (\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r}_0). \label{1.1}
\end{equation}
This modeling is called Gaussian Network Model (GNM) and is comminly used to study the dynamics of proteins.\\
To reduce the computational complexity of the problem while preserving essential structural features, we focus solely on the \(\alpha\)-carbon atoms because:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \(\alpha\)-carbon atoms form the backbone of the protein, defining its overall structure and shape.
    \item Their positions are sufficient to reconstruct the global three-dimensional conformation of the protein.
    \item Focusing on \(\alpha\)-carbons significantly reduces the complexity of the system, lowering the number of degrees of freedom and making calculations more efficient.
    \item The dynamics of \(\alpha\)-carbons often capture the collective motions of the protein, crucial for understanding its function (e.g., domain movements, opening of active sites).
    \item Experimental techniques such as X-ray crystallography and NMR frequently provide high-resolution data specifically for \(\alpha\)-carbon atoms, serving as reference points for modeling.
\end{itemize}

This model is overall extendable to all other atoms of the protein.
\newpage

\section{Interpretation of the Taylor Expansion}
\noindent  Equation \eqref{1.1} can be interpreted not only as the Hamiltonian of the harmonic oscillator (spring-system) but also as a network model, where every \(\alpha\)-carbon atom is a node interacting with other nodes.\cite{ref9}

\subsubsection{Definition of a Graph}
\noindent A graph \( G \) is a mathematical structure used to model pairwise relations between objects. It consists of a set of vertices \( V \) (also called nodes) and a set of edges \( E \), where each edge connects a pair of vertices.\cite{ref11}\\
Graphs can be directed or undirected, weighted or unweighted, depending on the nature of the relationships they represent.

\subsubsection{Kirchhoff Matrix (Laplacian Matrix)}
\noindent The Kirchhoff matrix, also known as the graph Laplacian, is a matrix representation of a graph that encodes information about its structure. For a graph \( G \) with \( n \) vertices, the Laplacian matrix \( L \) is defined as:\cite{ref11}

\begin{equation}
    L = D - A \label{Kirchhoff}
\end{equation}
Here:
- \( D \) is the degree matrix, a diagonal matrix defined as:
\begin{equation}
    D_{ij} = 
    \begin{cases} 
      \deg(v_i) & \text{if } i = j, \\
      0 & \text{if } i \neq j,
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}
where \( \deg(v_i) \) is the degree of vertex \( v_i \), i.e., the number of edges connected to vertex \( i \).

- \( A \) is the adjacency matrix, a square matrix defined as:
\begin{equation}
    A_{ij} = 
    \begin{cases} 
      1 & \text{if there is an edge between vertices } v_i \text{ and } v_j, \\
      0 & \text{otherwise}.
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}

The Laplacian matrix \( L \), derived from \( D \) and \( A \), captures essential properties of the graph, such as connectivity and flow. It is widely used in spectral graph theory, network analysis, and machine learning.
\subsubsection{Properties of the Degree Matrix}
The degree matrix \( D \) has the following properties:\cite{ref11}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Diagonal Matrix:} \( D \) is diagonal, meaning all off-diagonal elements are zero.
    \item \textbf{Non-Negative Entries:} Each diagonal element \( d_{ii} \) represents the degree of vertex \( i \), which is always non-negative.
    \item \textbf{Relation to Graph Order:} For simple graphs, the sum of all diagonal elements of \( D \) equals twice the number of edges, i.e., \( \mathrm{trace}(D) = 2|E| \).
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Properties of the Adjacency Matrix}
\noindent The adjacency matrix \( A \) encodes the edge structure of the graph and has the following properties:\cite{ref11}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Symmetry:} For undirected graphs, \( A \) is symmetric, i.e., \( a_{ij} = a_{ji} \).
    \item \textbf{Binary Entries:} For unweighted graphs, each element \( a_{ij} \in \{0, 1\} \), where \( 1 \) indicates the presence of an edge between \( i \) and \( j \), and \( 0 \) indicates absence.
    \item \textbf{Weighted Graphs:} For weighted graphs, \( a_{ij} \) takes the weight of the edge between vertices \( i \) and \( j \).
    \item \textbf{Self-Loops:} Diagonal entries \( a_{ii} \) indicate self-loops. For simple graphs, \( a_{ii} = 0 \).
    \item \textbf{Spectral Properties:} The eigenvalues of \( A \) provide insights into graph connectivity and other structural properties, such as bipartiteness and clustering.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Mathematical Properties of the Network}
\noindent The graph Laplacian has several important mathematical properties:\cite{ref11}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Symmetry:} For undirected graphs, \( L \) is symmetric and thus diagonalizable.
    \item \textbf{Positive Semi-definiteness:} The Laplacian matrix \( L \) is positive semi-definite, meaning that all its eigenvalues are non-negative.
    \item \textbf{Eigenvalues:} The smallest eigenvalue of \( L \) is always \( 0 \), corresponding to the eigenvector \( \mathbf{1} \) (a vector of all ones). The multiplicity of the zero eigenvalue indicates the number of connected components in the graph.
    \item \textbf{Combinatorial Interpretation:} The determinant of the reduced Laplacian matrix (obtained by removing one row and one column) gives the number of spanning trees in the graph.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Inverse of Weighted Laplacian (Pseudo-Inverse)}
For a connected graph, the weighted Laplacian \( L \) is not invertible due to the zero eigenvalue. However, the Moore-Penrose pseudo-inverse \( L^+ \) can be computed. 

The pseudo-inverse is used in various applications such as electrical network analysis, random walks, and graph-based optimization.\\ It satisfies:

\[
L^+ L = L L^+ = I - \frac{1}{n} \mathbf{1} \mathbf{1}^\top
\]

where \( n \) is the number of nodes and \( \mathbf{1} \) is a vector of all ones.
So it is the inverse of L in the subspace where L is invertible and minimize this difference $I - \frac{1}{n} \mathbf{1} \mathbf{1}^\top$.
\newpage
\section{Gaussian Network Model (GNM) and characteristics}
\noindent The Hamiltonian of the system can be expressed, following \eqref{1.1}, as:\cite{ref12}
\begin{equation}
    H(\mathbf{r}) \approx \frac{1}{2} (\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r}_0)^\top \mathbf{K} (\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r}_0),
\end{equation}
where \( \mathbf{K} \) is the Laplacian matrix. For simplicity, we can rewrite it as:
\begin{equation}
    H(\mathbf{r}) \approx \frac{1}{2} \mathbf{r}^\top \mathbf{K} \mathbf{r},
\end{equation}
or, in components:
\begin{equation}
    H(\mathbf{r}) \approx \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i,j} r_i K_{ij} r_j.
\end{equation}
Here, \(\mathbf{r}\) represents the displacement vector of atoms from their equilibrium positions.\\
This formulation of the system leads to several important properties and characteristics.

Initially, the probability density at equilibrium is given by:\cite{ref12}
\begin{equation}
    P(\mathbf{r}) = \frac{1}{Z} e^{-\beta H(\mathbf{r})},
\end{equation}
where the partition function \(Z\) is:
\begin{equation}
    Z = \int e^{-\beta H(\mathbf{r})} \, d\mathbf{r}.
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Mean Position}
\noindent The mean position \(\langle \mathbf{r} \rangle\) can be calculated as:\cite{ref12}
\begin{equation}
    \langle \mathbf{r} \rangle = \int \mathbf{r} P(\mathbf{r}) \, d\mathbf{r},
\end{equation}
where:
\begin{equation}
    P(\mathbf{r}) = \frac{1}{Z} e^{-\frac{\beta}{2} \mathbf{r}^\top \mathbf{K} \mathbf{r}},
\end{equation}
and the partition function is:\cite{ref12}
\begin{equation}
    Z = \int e^{-\frac{\beta}{2} \mathbf{r}^\top \mathbf{K} \mathbf{r}} \, d\mathbf{r}.
\end{equation}

Substituting \(P(\mathbf{r})\) into the expression for \(\langle \mathbf{r} \rangle\), we obtain:
\begin{equation}
    \langle \mathbf{r} \rangle = \frac{1}{Z} \int \mathbf{r} e^{-\frac{\beta}{2} \mathbf{r}^\top \mathbf{K} \mathbf{r}} \, d\mathbf{r}.
\end{equation}

Since the integrand \(\mathbf{r} e^{-\frac{\beta}{2} \mathbf{r}^\top \mathbf{K} \mathbf{r}}\) is symmetric with respect to \(\mathbf{r}\), and there are no linear terms in the Hamiltonian, the Gaussian distribution is centered at \(\mathbf{r} = 0\). Therefore:\cite{ref12}
\begin{equation}
    \langle \mathbf{r} \rangle = 0.
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Covariance}
\noindent The covariance between \(r_i\) and \(r_j\) is defined as:\cite{ref12}
\begin{equation}
    \text{Cov}(r_i, r_j) = \langle r_i r_j \rangle - \langle r_i \rangle \langle r_j \rangle.
\end{equation}

Since \(\langle r_i \rangle = 0\), it simplifies to:
\begin{equation}
    \text{Cov}(r_i, r_j) = \langle r_i r_j \rangle.
\end{equation}

Using the Boltzmann distribution:
\begin{equation}
    P(\mathbf{r}) = \frac{1}{Z} e^{-\frac{\beta}{2} \mathbf{r}^\top \mathbf{K} \mathbf{r}},
\end{equation}
we calculate:
\begin{equation}
    \langle r_i r_j \rangle = \frac{1}{Z} \int r_i r_j e^{-\frac{\beta}{2} \mathbf{r}^\top \mathbf{K} \mathbf{r}} \, d\mathbf{r}.
\end{equation}

For a Gaussian distribution, the covariance matrix is given by:
\begin{equation}
    \bm{\Sigma} = \beta^{-1} \mathbf{K}^{-1} = \langle r_i r_j \rangle,
\end{equation}
where \((\mathbf{K}^{-1})_{ij}\) represents the \((i,j)\)-th element of \(\mathbf{K}^{-1}\). Thus:
\begin{equation}
    \text{Cov}(r_i, r_j) = \frac{1}{\beta} (\mathbf{K}^{-1})_{ij}.
\end{equation}



\subsection{QUESTA PARTE IN CUI METTO LA DERIVAZIOEN DEI BETA FACTORS LA METTO? Referenza materia condensata sapienza}
\subsection{Derivation of diffraction intensity with atomic vibrations}
\noindent The diffraction intensity in crystallography is influenced by the atomic vibrations around their mean positions. These vibrations are characterized by the mean squared displacement, denoted as $\langle u^2 \rangle$. To derive the expression for intensity, we start with the electron density modulated by atomic displacement.

Let the position of an atom be $\mathbf{r}$, with its displacement modeled as a Gaussian distribution around its mean position $\mathbf{r_0}$. The thermal motion leads to a modification of the scattering factor:
\[
f(\mathbf{q}) = f_0(\mathbf{q}) \cdot e^{-2\pi i \mathbf{q} \cdot \mathbf{u}}
\]
where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $f_0(\mathbf{q})$: scattering factor for a stationary atom,
    \item $\mathbf{q}$: scattering vector,
    \item $\mathbf{u}$: displacement from the mean position.
\end{itemize}

The observed intensity $I(\mathbf{q})$ is proportional to the squared magnitude of the structure factor $F(\mathbf{q})$:
\[
I(\mathbf{q}) \propto |F(\mathbf{q})|^2,
\]
where $F(\mathbf{q})$ is the sum over all atomic contributions:
\[
F(\mathbf{q}) = \sum_j f_j(\mathbf{q}) e^{2\pi i \mathbf{q} \cdot \mathbf{r}_j}.
\]

Now consider the thermal vibrations. Averaging over the Gaussian distribution of displacements yields a damping factor:
\[
\langle e^{-2\pi i \mathbf{q} \cdot \mathbf{u}} \rangle = e^{-2\pi^2 \langle (\mathbf{q} \cdot \mathbf{u})^2 \rangle}.
\]
Assuming isotropic vibrations, this simplifies to:
\[
\langle (\mathbf{q} \cdot \mathbf{u})^2 \rangle = |\mathbf{q}|^2 \langle u^2 \rangle,
\]
where $\langle u^2 \rangle$ is the mean squared displacement. Substituting this back, the intensity is:
\[
I(\mathbf{q}) \propto |F(\mathbf{q})|^2 e^{-8\pi^2 \langle u^2 \rangle |\mathbf{q}|^2}.
\]

The factor $B = 8\pi^2 \langle u^2 \rangle$ emerges naturally, leading to:
\[
I(\mathbf{q}) \propto |F(\mathbf{q})|^2 e^{-B |\mathbf{q}|^2}.
\]

\subsection{Evaluation of beta factors and model quality}
\noindent In crystallography, the Beta factors (\(B\)) are an important metric to assess the quality of a structural model. The value of \(B\) is given by:
\begin{equation}
    B = 8\pi^2 \langle u^2 \rangle = 8\pi^2 \frac{k_B T}{k_{\text{eff}}} \label{Kirchhoff}
\end{equation}

Where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \(\langle u^2 \rangle\): mean squared atomic displacement,
    \item \(k_B\): Boltzmann constant,
    \item \(T\): absolute temperature,
    \item \(k_{\text{eff}}\): effective spring constant (describing atomic rigidity).
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Importance of the beta factor as a metric of model accuracy}
\noindent The beta factor ($B$) is a crucial metric in crystallographic modeling for several reasons:

\subsubsection{1. Representation of atomic dynamics}
The beta factor reflects the thermal vibrations and dynamic behavior of atoms within the crystal. High $B$ values indicate greater atomic mobility or disorder, while low $B$ values suggest rigidity.

\subsubsection{2. Assessment of structural flexibility}
Regions with elevated beta factors often correspond to flexible or disordered parts of the molecule, such as loops, termini, or unstructured regions. These provide insights into the functional dynamics of the macromolecule.

\subsubsection{3. Indicator of model quality}
Unrealistically high or low beta factors across the structure can indicate modeling errors or issues with data quality, such as:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Poor resolution of the diffraction data.
    \item Incorrect assignment of atomic positions.
    \item Misrepresentation of isotropic vs. anisotropic motion.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{4. Validation of refinement}
\noindent During model refinement, the beta factors are optimized to fit the experimental data. If the refinement process yields consistent and reasonable beta factors, it supports the accuracy of the atomic model.

\chapter{Introduction to causality and causality in allosteric mechanisms of proteins (Qui è molto sottile il discorso e probabilmente non dovrei toccare alcuni punti)}

\noindent Correlation not only hinders testing the quality of models through beta factors but also obstructs understanding interactions and the relations between nodes/residues.\\
Our primary aim is to identify the allosteric site—the region from which a signal is transmitted to other sites of the protein, but as is often said, correlation does not imply causation.

\begin{figure}[h]

    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{/Users/enrico/PROTEINS/tesi/immagini_tesi_ingelse/corrCause1.png}    
    \caption{Correlation is not causation.}
    \label{fig:Correlation is not causation}
\end{figure}

Causality refers to the relationship between causes and effects, where one event (the cause) directly influences or produces another event (the effect). 

Causality is a foundational concept across disciplines, including physics, philosophy, and statistics. It implies a directional influence, where the cause precedes the effect and is necessary, sufficient, or contributory for the effect to occur.

In mathematical terms, causal relationships are often modeled as:\cite{ref14}
\[
B = f(A, \text{other factors}),
\]
where \( f \) describes how \( A \) and other factors jointly determine \( B \). 

Experimentally, causality is typically established through controlled interventions and the observation of resulting changes.
\newpage
\section{Deterministic and Stochastic Causality}

\noindent Causality can be classified into two main types: deterministic and stochastic.

\subsection{Deterministic Causality}

\noindent Deterministic causality implies that a specific cause invariably leads to a specific effect. If an event \( A \) causes an event \( B \), then \( B \) always occurs whenever \( A \) occurs. This relationship can be expressed as \( A \implies B \), meaning \( A \) is both necessary and sufficient for \( B \). Deterministic causality is observed in systems governed by precise physical laws, such as classical mechanics, where given initial conditions and forces, trajectories are entirely predictable.

\subsection{Stochastic Causality}

\noindent Stochastic causality acknowledges that many causal relationships are probabilistic rather than absolute. Here, the occurrence of \( A \) increases the likelihood of \( B \), but \( B \) does not always follow \( A \). This is expressed probabilistically as \( P(B|A) > P(B|\neg A) \), indicating that \( A \) raises the probability of \( B \). Stochastic causality is prevalent in complex systems like biology or social sciences, where multiple interacting factors and inherent randomness influence outcomes. For example, smoking increases the probability of lung cancer, though not all smokers develop the disease.

Both deterministic and stochastic causality are critical for understanding natural phenomena. Deterministic causality offers precise predictive power, while stochastic causality is indispensable for modeling systems where randomness and variability play significant roles. Together, they provide a comprehensive framework for analyzing causal relationships.
\newpage
\section{Geometric Perspective of Causality and Shannon Entropy (questa è la parte piu' da togliere fra tutte probabilmente)}

\noindent When all dimensions or variables of a system are fully known, uncertainty about future states vanishes, transitioning the system into a deterministic regime. This idea relates to Shannon entropy, defined as:
\[
H(X) = -\sum_{i} P(x_i) \log P(x_i),
\]
where \( X \) is a random variable with possible states \( x_i \), and \( P(x_i) \) is the probability of \( x_i \). When \( P(x_i) = \delta(x_i) \) -> \( H(X) = 0 \), the system has no uncertainty, indicating complete predictability.
So if my target variable has the distirbution of the delta function, the entropy is zero, so the system is deterministic.
In deterministic systems, knowing all dimensions eliminates ambiguity, enabling precise predictions of future states. However, in practice i don't know all the dimensions of my system.
Thus, while \( H(X) = 0 \) theoretically implies determinism, real-world complexities and limitations must be accounted for.


To understand the causality of allosteric mechanisms in proteins, it is crucial to investigate the physical interactions and pathways that transmit signals between distant sites. For this reason, additional indicators are needed.
\newpage
\section{Correlation}
\subsection{Correlation Between Fluctuations}
\noindent
The correlation between two variables, such as the fluctuations in the positions of particles \( i \) and \( j \), provides insight into how these components of the system interact.\\
The correlation function is defined as:\cite{ref13}
\begin{equation}
    C_{ij} = \langle \delta \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \delta \mathbf{r}_j \rangle, \label{correlation}
\end{equation}
where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( \delta \mathbf{r}_i = \mathbf{r}_i - \langle \mathbf{r}_i \rangle \) is the deviation of the position of particle \( i \) from its equilibrium value.
    \item \( \delta \mathbf{r}_j = \mathbf{r}_j - \langle \mathbf{r}_j \rangle \) is the deviation of the position of particle \( j \) from its equilibrium value.
    \item \( \langle \cdot \rangle \) denotes an ensemble average.
\end{itemize}

The correlation \( C_{ij} \) quantifies the degree to which the positions of particles \( i \) and \( j \) are linearly related at equilibrium.

\subsection{Physical Interpretation of Correlations}

\noindent The correlation \( C_{ij} \) reflects how strongly two particles are connected in the system:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Positive correlation:} A positive \( C_{ij} > 0 \) indicates that fluctuations in \( \mathbf{r}_i \) and \( \mathbf{r}_j \) tend to occur in the same direction, suggesting cooperative behavior or a direct connection.
    \item \textbf{Negative correlation:} A negative \( C_{ij} < 0 \) implies that fluctuations in \( \mathbf{r}_i \) and \( \mathbf{r}_j \) tend to occur in opposite directions, indicating opposing interactions or constraints between the particles.
    \item \textbf{Zero correlation:} A correlation of \( C_{ij} = 0 \) indicates no linear relationship between the fluctuations, suggesting either independence or non-linear interactions.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Why Correlation Alone is Not Causation}

\noindent While correlations reveal interactions, they do not establish a causal relationship. The limitations include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Symmetry:} Correlation is symmetric (\( C_{ij} = C_{ji} \)), whereas causality is asymmetric. The fact that \( i \) is correlated with \( j \) does not imply that \( i \) causes \( j \) or vice versa.
    \item \textbf{Confounding variables:} Correlation can arise due to a common cause influencing both \( i \) and \( j \), rather than a direct causal link between them.
    \item \textbf{Indirect interactions:} Correlation can reflect indirect interactions mediated by other components of the system, rather than a direct causal pathway.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Using Correlations to Infer Interaction Networks}

\noindent Despite its limitations, correlation is a powerful tool for mapping interaction networks in complex systems. For example:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Identifying connected components:} Strong correlations can indicate direct physical or functional connections between components.
    \item \textbf{Inferring collective behavior:} Patterns of correlations across multiple components can reveal collective modes of motion or global interactions in the system.
    \item \textbf{Complementing causal analysis:} Correlation provides a starting point for exploring causal relationships, which can be further refined using response functions and perturbation experiments.
\end{itemize}

In summary, correlation serves as a valuable indicator of interactions within a system. However, establishing causality requires additional analysis, such as studying response functions or applying controlled perturbations.
\section{Linear Response Theorem}

\noindent The linear response theorem describes how the average position of a particle $i$, denoted as $\langle \mathbf{r}_i \rangle$, responds to a perturbation applied to another particle $j$ through an external force $f_j$. The response is given by:
\begin{equation}
R_{ij} = \frac{\partial \langle \mathbf{r}_i \rangle}{\partial f_j},
\end{equation}
where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\mathbf{r}_i$ is the position of particle $i$ relative to its equilibrium position.
    \item $f_j$ is an external force applied to particle $j$.
    \item $\langle \mathbf{r}_i \rangle$ is the average position of particle $i$.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Derivation and Relation to Correlations}

\noindent To derive the connection between the response and the correlations of position fluctuations, consider the Hamiltonian of the system under a small external perturbation:
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{H} = \mathcal{H}_0 - \sum_j f_j \mathbf{r}_j,
\end{equation}
where $\mathcal{H}_0$ is the unperturbed Hamiltonian and $-f_j \mathbf{r}_j$ is the interaction term between the external force and the position of particle $j$.

\noindent The average position of particle $i$ in the perturbed system is given by:
\begin{equation}
\langle \mathbf{r}_i \rangle = \frac{\int \mathbf{r}_i e^{-\beta \mathcal{H}} \, d\mathbf{r}}{\int e^{-\beta \mathcal{H}} \, d\mathbf{r}},
\end{equation}
where $\beta = \frac{1}{k_B T}$ is the inverse thermal energy, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $T$ is the temperature.

\noindent Expanding the exponential $e^{-\beta \mathcal{H}}$ to first order in the perturbation $f_j$:
\begin{equation}
e^{-\beta \mathcal{H}} \approx e^{-\beta \mathcal{H}_0} \left( 1 + \beta f_j \mathbf{r}_j \right),
\end{equation}
and substituting this expansion into the expression for $\langle \mathbf{r}_i \rangle$:
\begin{equation}
\langle \mathbf{r}_i \rangle \approx \langle \mathbf{r}_i \rangle_0 + \beta f_j \langle \delta \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \delta \mathbf{r}_j \rangle,
\end{equation}
where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\langle \mathbf{r}_i \rangle_0$ is the average position of particle $i$ in the absence of perturbation.
    \item $\delta \mathbf{r}_i = \mathbf{r}_i - \langle \mathbf{r}_i \rangle_0$ is the fluctuation of the position relative to its equilibrium value.
    \item $\langle \delta \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \delta \mathbf{r}_j \rangle$ is the scalar product of position fluctuations between particles $i$ and $j$.
\end{itemize}

\noindent Taking the derivative of $\langle \mathbf{r}_i \rangle$ with respect to $f_j$ gives the response:

\begin{equation}
R_{ij} = \frac{\partial \langle \mathbf{r}_i \rangle}{\partial f_j} = \beta \langle \delta \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \delta \mathbf{r}_j \rangle. \label{response}
\end{equation}

\noindent This result shows that the response $R_{ij}$ is directly proportional to the equilibrium correlation between the fluctuations of the positions of particles $i$ and $j$, a manifestation of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem.

\subsection{Physical Interpretation}

\noindent This result states that the linear response of the system to a perturbation is proportional to the thermal correlation between the fluctuations of the particles' positions. It reflects the connection between the equilibrium properties of the system and its dynamic response.

\subsection{Why is Linear Response an Indicator of Causality?}

The linear response \(R_{ij}\) can be interpreted as an indicator of causality because it measures the direct influence of a change in parameter \(j\) (e.g., an external force) on variable \(i\) (e.g., position, velocity, or another observable). This connection arises for the following reasons:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Direct cause-effect relationship:} The response \(R_{ij}\) explicitly quantifies how a perturbation \(f_j\) applied to \(j\) influences the behavior of \(i\). This reflects causality since the perturbation precedes the response.
    \item \textbf{Asymmetry of the response:} Causality implies asymmetry: if \(j\) causes a change in \(i\), the reverse (i.e., \(i\) influencing \(j\)) does not necessarily occur. In the linear response framework, \(R_{ij}\) specifically measures the influence of \(j\) on \(i\).
    \item \textbf{Relation to equilibrium correlations:} The proportionality \(R_{ij} = \beta \langle \delta \mathbf{r}_i \cdot \delta \mathbf{r}_j \rangle\) implies that the equilibrium correlations encode information about the system's ability to propagate changes. This reinforces the causal interpretation.
\end{itemize}

In summary, the linear response is a quantitative framework to understand how perturbations propagate through a system, reflecting causal influences between different components.
\newpage
\section{Transfer Entropy: Formula, Proof, and Causality}

\subsection{Definition of Transfer Entropy}
\noindent The Transfer Entropy (TE) measures the directional flow of information from a source variable \(x_j\) to a target variable \(x_i\).\\
It quantifies how much the knowledge of past states of \(x_j\) improves the prediction of future states of \(x_i\), beyond what is already provided by the past states of \(x_i\) itself. \\
The TE is defined as:\cite{ref13}

\[
TE_{j \to i}(t) = H[x_i(t + \tau) \mid x_i(\tau)] - H[x_i(t + \tau) \mid x_i(\tau), x_j(\tau)]
\]

Where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \(H[a \mid b]\): Conditional Shannon entropy of variable \(a\) given \(b\).
    \item \(x_i(t + \tau)\): State of \(x_i\) at time \(t + \tau\).
    \item \(x_i(\tau), x_j(\tau)\): States of \(x_i\) and \(x_j\) at time \(\tau\).
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection*{Shannon Entropy}
Transfer Entropy is based on \textbf{Shannon entropy}, which measures the uncertainty of a probability distribution. For a variable \( X \) with distribution \( P(x) \), the entropy is:

\[
H(X) = - \sum_{x} P(x) \log P(x).
\]

For a conditional distribution \( P(x | y) \), the \textbf{conditional entropy} is:

\[
H(X | Y) = - \sum_{x, y} P(x, y) \log P(x | y).
\]

Thus, Transfer Entropy measures the reduction in uncertainty of \( x_2(t + \tau) \) when considering \( x_1 \) as an additional source of information.

---

\subsection*{Example: Predicting Temperature with Humidity and Pressure}

Let us consider a system where we want to predict the \textbf{temperature} \( T \) using two variables:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( H \): Humidity (e.g., relative humidity in percentage),
    \item \( P \): Atmospheric pressure (e.g., in hPa).
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Case 1: Using Humidity \( H \) Alone}
We divide the \textbf{phase space} of \( H \) into bins \( B_k \) (e.g., \( [30\%-40\%], [40\%-50\%], \ldots \)).  
The conditional probability distribution of the temperature \( T \) is \( P(T | H \in B_k) \), and the conditional Shannon entropy is:

\[
H(T | H) = - \sum_{k} P(B_k) \sum_{T} P(T | H \in B_k) \log P(T | H \in B_k).
\]

In this case, the uncertainty about \( T \) remains high because \( H \) alone may not fully explain the temperature.

\subsubsection*{Case 2: Using Both Humidity \( H \) and Pressure \( P \)}
We now divide the phase space into **squares** \( Q_{kl} \), combining intervals of \( H \) and \( P \), where:

\[
Q_{kl} = \{ H \in B_k, P \in C_l \},
\]
with \( B_k \) being intervals of \( H \) and \( C_l \) intervals of \( P \).

The conditional probability distribution of \( T \) is now \( P(T | H \in B_k, P \in C_l) \), and the conditional Shannon entropy becomes:

\[
H(T | H, P) = - \sum_{k, l} P(Q_{kl}) \sum_{T} P(T | H \in B_k, P \in C_l) \log P(T | H \in B_k, P \in C_l).
\]

\subsubsection*{Calculation of Transfer Entropy}
The Transfer Entropy measures the informational contribution of \( P \) to predicting \( T \), beyond what is provided by \( H \) alone:

\[
TE_{P \to T} = H(T | H) - H(T | H, P).
\]

If pressure \( P \) provides significant additional information:
\[
H(T | H, P) < H(T | H),
\]
and the \textbf{Transfer Entropy} is positive:

\[
TE_{P \to T} > 0.
\]

---

\subsection*{Interpretation}
\begin{itemize}
    \item When using only humidity \( H \), the distribution of \( T \) has a high variance and the entropy is large.
    \item Adding pressure \( P \) reduces the variance of the temperature distribution, as the combined information from \( H \) and \( P \) explains \( T \) more accurately.
    \item Consequently, the conditional entropy decreases, and the Transfer Entropy quantifies this reduction in uncertainty.
\end{itemize}



\subsection{Transfer Entropy for Gaussian Systems}

\noindent Transfer Entropy (TE) is a powerful measure of directed information transfer between stochastic processes. For stationary Gaussian processes, TE can be computed analytically using the covariance matrices of the processes involved. The TE from \(x_j\) to \(x_i\) at a time lag \(t\) is given by:\cite{ref13}



\begin{equation}
TE_{j \to i}(t) = -\frac{1}{2} \ln{1 - \frac{\alpha_{ij}(t)}{\beta_{ij}(t)}}=TE_{i,j},\label{TE}
\end{equation}

where:

\begin{equation}
\alpha_{ij}(t) = \left[C_{ii}(0)C_{ij}(t) - C_{ij}(0)C_{ii}(t)\right]^2,\label{alpha}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\beta_{ij}(t) = \left[C_{ii}(0)C_{jj}(0) - C_{ij}^2(0)\right]\left[C_{ii}^2(0) - C_{ii}^2(t)\right].\label{beta}
\end{equation}

Here:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \(C_{ij}(t)\) is the time-lagged cross-correlation between \(x_i\) and \(x_j\),
    \item \(C_{ii}(0)\) and \(C_{jj}(0)\) are the variances of \(x_i\) and \(x_j\), respectively.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Proof Sketch for Gaussian TE}

The derivation of Transfer Entropy (TE) for Gaussian systems leverages the fact that the entropy of a multivariate Gaussian distribution depends only on the determinant of its covariance matrix.\\
This section provides a step-by-step explanation of the derivation for \( TE_{j \to i}(t) \).\cite{ref13}



Consider a system described by the variables \(x_i(t)\), \(x_i(0)\), and \(x_j(0)\). The joint covariance matrix of these variables is:

\[
\Omega = \begin{bmatrix}
C_{ii}(0) & C_{ii}(t) & C_{ij}(t) \\
C_{ii}(t) & C_{ii}(0) & C_{ij}(0) \\
C_{ij}(t) & C_{ij}(0) & C_{jj}(0)
\end{bmatrix},
\]

where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \(C_{ii}(0)\) and \(C_{jj}(0)\) are the variances of \(x_i\) and \(x_j\), respectively,
    \item \(C_{ii}(t)\) is the autocovariance of \(x_i\) at time lag \(t\),
    \item \(C_{ij}(t)\) is the cross-covariance between \(x_i(t)\) and \(x_j(0)\),
    \item \(C_{ij}(0)\) is the instantaneous cross-covariance between \(x_i(0)\) and \(x_j(0)\).
\end{itemize}



The entropy of a multivariate Gaussian distribution is given by:
\[
H(\mathbf{x}) = \frac{1}{2} \ln{[(2\pi e)^n \det(\Sigma)]},
\]
where \(n\) is the dimensionality of \(\mathbf{x}\), and \(\Sigma\) is its covariance matrix.

For the variables \([x_i(t), x_i(0), x_j(0)]\), the entropy is:
\[
H(x_i(t), x_i(0), x_j(0)) = \frac{1}{2} \ln{[(2\pi e)^3 \det(\Omega)]}.
\]


The conditional entropy of \(x_i(t)\) given \([x_i(0), x_j(0)]\) is computed using the Schur complement. For a covariance matrix partitioned as:
\[
\Omega = \begin{bmatrix}
A & B \\
B^\top & C
\end{bmatrix},
\]
the Schur complement of \(C\) in \(\Omega\) is:
\[
\Sigma_{x_i(t) | x_i(0), x_j(0)} = A - B C^{-1} B^\top.
\]

In our case, the conditional covariance matrix for \(x_i(t)\) given \(x_i(0)\) and \(x_j(0)\) is:
\[
\Sigma_{x_i(t) | x_i(0), x_j(0)} = C_{ii}(0) - \begin{bmatrix}
C_{ii}(t) & C_{ij}(t)
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
C_{ii}(0) & C_{ij}(0) \\
C_{ij}(0) & C_{jj}(0)
\end{bmatrix}^{-1}
\begin{bmatrix}
C_{ii}(t) \\
C_{ij}(t)
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The entropy is then:
\[
H(x_i(t) | x_i(0), x_j(0)) = \frac{1}{2} \ln{[2\pi e \det\left(\Sigma_{x_i(t) | x_i(0), x_j(0)}\right)]}.
\]

Similarly, the conditional covariance matrix for \(x_i(t)\) given \(x_i(0)\) is:
\[
\Sigma_{x_i(t) | x_i(0)} = C_{ii}(0) - \frac{C_{ii}^2(t)}{C_{ii}(0)}.
\]

The entropy is:
\[
H(x_i(t) | x_i(0)) = \frac{1}{2} \ln{[2\pi e \det\left(\Sigma_{x_i(t) | x_i(0)}\right)]}.
\]


Transfer Entropy is defined as:
\[
TE_{j \to i}(t) = H(x_i(t) | x_i(0)) - H(x_i(t) | x_i(0), x_j(0)).
\]

Substituting the expressions for the conditional entropies:
\[
TE_{j \to i}(t) = \frac{1}{2} \ln{[\frac{\det{(\Sigma_{x_i(t) | x_i(0)})}}{\det{(\Sigma_{x_i(t) | x_i(0), x_j(0)})}}]}.
\]

Using the determinant properties of Gaussian covariance matrices and after algebraic manipulation, this simplifies to:
\[
TE_{j \to i}(t) = -\frac{1}{2} \ln {(1 - \frac{\alpha_{ij}(t)}{\beta_{ij}(t)})},
\]
where:
\[
\alpha_{ij}(t) = \left[C_{ii}(0)C_{ij}(t) - C_{ij}(0)C_{ii}(t)\right]^2,
\]
\[
\beta_{ij}(t) = \left[C_{ii}(0)C_{jj}(0) - C_{ij}^2(0)\right]\left[C_{ii}^2(0) - C_{ii}^2(t)\right].
\]

This is the analytical formula for Transfer Entropy in Gaussian systems.

The final expression reveals how the directed information transfer from \(x_j\) to \(x_i\) depends on:\\
1. The time-lagged cross-correlation \(C_{ij}(t)\),\\
2. The variances \(C_{ii}(0)\) and \(C_{jj}(0)\),\\
3. The instantaneous cross-correlation \(C_{ij}(0)\),\\
4. The autocovariance \(C_{ii}(t)\).\\

This formula captures the influence of \(x_j\) on \(x_i\) while accounting for their shared history, providing a rigorous measure of causality.

\subsection{Causality and Transfer Entropy}

\noindent Transfer Entropy is widely regarded as an indicator of causality because it quantifies directed information flow between variables. The key reasons include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Directionality:} Unlike correlation, TE is asymmetric (\(TE_{j \to i} \neq TE_{i \to j}\)). This asymmetry reflects the directional influence of \(x_j\) on \(x_i\), aligning with the principle of causation.
    \item \textbf{Temporal dependence:} TE explicitly incorporates time-lagged variables, ensuring that the direction of information flow respects temporal precedence, a fundamental requirement for causal inference.
    \item \textbf{Beyond correlation:} While correlation measures symmetric associations, TE captures the dynamic influence of \(x_j\) on \(x_i\), conditioned on their past states. This conditioning eliminates spurious correlations arising from common drivers or indirect interactions.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Relation to Correlation and Response Functions}

\noindent The relationship between Transfer Entropy, correlation, and response functions highlights their complementary roles in understanding causality:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Correlation as a precursor:} Correlation measures the strength of association but is symmetric and does not imply causation. TE builds upon this by quantifying directed dependencies.
    \item \textbf{Response functions as a mechanism:} Linear response functions describe how perturbations in one variable influence another. They are closely related to correlations through the fluctuation-dissipation theorem and provide a mechanistic basis for TE.
    \item \textbf{TE as a probabilistic extension:} TE extends the concepts of correlation and response functions into a probabilistic framework. It quantifies not just direct influences but also the flow of information, incorporating both linear and non-linear dependencies.
\end{itemize}

By combining these tools, one can construct a comprehensive picture of causality in complex systems, where TE provides a probabilistic and directional perspective, correlation identifies initial associations, and response functions reveal the underlying mechanisms.

\subsection{Comparison with Correlation}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Symmetry:} Correlation is symmetric (\(C_{ij} = C_{ji}\)), whereas TE is directional.
    \item \textbf{Causal inference:} Correlation measures only association, which can be spurious. TE identifies directed influences and distinguishes cause from effect.
    \item \textbf{Applications:} TE is particularly useful in systems with nonlinear dynamics, where correlations may fail to capture the true dependencies.
\end{itemize}













\chapter{Stochastic Processes}  \label{chap:stochastic_processes}
A stochastic process is a mathematical framework used to describe systems that evolve over time in a probabilistic manner.\\
By definition, a stochastic process associates a set of random variables \( \{X_t\}_{t \geq 0} \) to time \( t \), where each random variable \( X_t \) represents the state of the system at a specific time point. 

Such processes are essential in modeling phenomena in physics, biology, finance, and many other fields, where uncertainty and noise play significant roles.
\section{General Framework}
\noindent The dynamics of a stochastic process are governed by probabilistic laws that combine deterministic and random components. In general, the evolution can be expressed as:
\begin{equation}
    \gamma\frac{dX_t}{dt} = -\nabla H(X_t) + \sqrt{2 \gamma k_B T} \eta_t,
\end{equation}
where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( X_t \) represents the state of the system at time \( t \),
    \item \( H(X_t) \) is the Hamiltonian function, which dictates the deterministic behavior,
    \item \( \nabla H(X_t) \) is the gradient of the Hamiltonian, the force, describing the deterministic direction of motion,
    \item \( \eta_t \) is a stochastic noise term, modeled as Gaussian white noise with zero mean and variance \( \sigma^2 \), i.e., \( \langle \eta_t \eta_{t'} \rangle = \sigma^2 \delta(t-t') \).
    \item \( \gamma \) is the friction coefficient, which represents the dissipative interaction with the environment,
    \item \( k_B \) is the Boltzmann constant, a fundamental physical constant relating temperature and energy,
    \item \( T \) is the temperature of the surrounding environment, which determines the intensity of thermal fluctuations.

\end{itemize}
For simplicity, we set \( \gamma = 0.5 \, \text{s}^{-1} \), \( k_B = 1 \, \text{J/K} \), and \( T = 1 \, \text{K} \).
So it becomes:
\begin{equation}
    \frac{dX_t}{dt} = -\nabla H(X_t) + \eta_t,
\end{equation}
This rescaling simplifies the equations and numerical implementation, as the physical constants no longer appear explicitly.
\subsection{Dynamics in Vectorial Form}
Substituting the gradient into the general stochastic equation, using \eqref{1.1}, the dynamics can be expressed in vectorial form as:
\begin{equation}
\frac{d\mathbf{r}_t}{dt} = -\mathbf{K} \mathbf{r}_t + \boldsymbol{\eta}_t,
\end{equation}
where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( \mathbf{r}_t \) is the state vector at time \( t \),
    \item \( -\mathbf{K} \mathbf{r}_t \) is the deterministic term driving the system towards equilibrium,
    \item \( \boldsymbol{\eta}_t \) is a vector of independent Gaussian noise components.
\end{itemize}

In component form, the dynamics for each element \( i \) are:
\begin{equation}
    \frac{d r_{i,t}}{dt} = -\sum_j K_{ij} r_{j,t} + \eta_{i,t}.
\end{equation}
The described dynamics correspond to a multidimensional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, which is the simplest continuous-time Gaussian process with a mean-reverting property.\\
These processes are used extensively in modeling systems with memory and noise.\\

\section{Introduction to Normal Modes and Their Physical Significance in Proteins}

Normal modes are a powerful tool for understanding protein dynamics. \\
They are derived from the diagonalization of the Hessian matrix \eqref{hessian}, \( \mathbf{H} \), which encapsulates the curvature of the potential energy surface near a local minimum. 

\subsection{Normal Modes as Eigenvectors of the Hessian Matrix}

Normal modes are the eigenvectors \( \mathbf{v}_k \) of the Hessian matrix. These eigenvectors correspond to collective motions of the system, and the associated eigenvalues \( \lambda_k \) are proportional to the squared frequencies of these motions:

\begin{equation}
\mathbf{H} \mathbf{v}_k = \lambda_k \mathbf{v}_k.
\end{equation}

To understand why this relation holds, consider a Taylor expansion of the potential energy \( V(\mathbf{x}) \) around a local minimum at \( \mathbf{x}_0 \):

\begin{equation}
V(\mathbf{x}) \approx V_0 + \frac{1}{2} \mathbf{x}^T \mathbf{H} \mathbf{x},
\end{equation}

where \( V_0 \) is the potential energy at the minimum, and \( \mathbf{x} \) represents the displacement from equilibrium. This quadratic approximation assumes small displacements, making the system effectively harmonic.

\subsection{Equations of Motion in Terms of Normal Modes}

From classical mechanics, the force \( \mathbf{F} \) is related to the gradient of the potential energy:

\begin{equation}
\mathbf{F} = -\nabla V(\mathbf{x}) = -\mathbf{H} \mathbf{x}.
\end{equation}

Newton's second law gives the equation of motion:

\begin{equation}
M \ddot{\mathbf{x}} = -\mathbf{H} \mathbf{x},
\end{equation}

where \( M \) is the diagonal mass matrix. To simplify, we normalize the coordinates by the square root of the masses: \( \mathbf{x}' = \sqrt{M} \mathbf{x} \). Substituting this transformation, the equation of motion becomes:

\begin{equation}
\ddot{\mathbf{x}} = -\mathbf{H} \mathbf{x}.
\end{equation}

Now, assume solutions of the form \( \mathbf{x}(t) = \mathbf{v}_k e^{i \omega_k t} \), where \( \omega_k \) is the angular frequency of the \( k \)-th mode and \( \mathbf{v}_k \) is the corresponding eigenvector. Substituting this into the equation of motion:

\begin{equation}
-\omega_k^2 \mathbf{v}_k = -\mathbf{H} \mathbf{v}_k.
\end{equation}

This equation demonstrates that \( \lambda_k \), the eigenvalue of the Hessian, is related to the angular frequency by:

\begin{equation}
\omega_k^2 = \lambda_k.
\end{equation}

Taking the square root, the normal mode frequencies are given by:

\begin{equation}
\omega_k = \sqrt{\lambda_k}.
\end{equation}

For a protein consisting of \( N \) atoms, there are \( 3N \) degrees of freedom corresponding to the \( x \), \( y \), and \( z \) coordinates of each atom. However, six degrees of freedom (three translations and three rotations) are associated with rigid-body motions, leaving \( 3N - 6 \) internal vibrational modes. For linear molecules, five degrees of freedom correspond to rigid-body motions, leaving \( 3N - 5 \) modes.

The eigenvectors \( \mathbf{v}_k \) describe the directions of motion in the high-dimensional space of atomic coordinates. Each mode corresponds to a distinct collective motion of the protein, providing insight into its dynamic properties.

\subsection{Physical Interpretation of Normal Modes in Proteins}

In proteins, normal modes describe collective oscillations of atoms that are often highly correlated. These oscillations can be visualized as "breathing," twisting, or bending motions of the protein structure. The low-frequency modes, corresponding to small eigenvalues, are particularly important because they involve large-scale, global movements of the protein, which are typically associated with biological functions such as:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Opening and closing of ligand-binding sites.
    \item Allosteric transitions, where a change in one part of the protein affects another distant site.
    \item Elastic deformations that stabilize the protein under mechanical stress.
\end{itemize}

The relationship between these motions and protein function is grounded in the energy landscape theory, which posits that the functional motions of a protein are encoded in its native structure and the curvature of its potential energy surface.

\section{Analytical Solution of stochastic process with normal modes}
\section{Solving the Dynamics Using Normal Modes}

The dynamics of the system is governed by the equation:

\begin{equation}
\frac{d r_{i,t}}{dt} = -\sum_j K_{ij} r_{j,t} + \eta_{i,t},
\end{equation}

or equivalently in vector form:

\begin{equation}
\frac{d \mathbf{r}_t}{dt} = -\mathbf{K} \mathbf{r}_t + \boldsymbol{\eta}_t,
\end{equation}

where:
- \( \mathbf{r}_t \) is the vector of the system variables,
- \( \mathbf{K} \) is the Kirchhoff matrix, symmetric and diagonalizable,
- \( \boldsymbol{\eta}_t \) represents stochastic noise.
\section{Solution of the Stochastic Equation}

\subsection{Diagonalizing \(\mathbf{K}\)}

Since \(\mathbf{K}\) is symmetric, it can be diagonalized:
\[
\mathbf{K} = \mathbf{U} \boldsymbol{\Lambda} \mathbf{U}^\dagger,
\]
where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \(\mathbf{U}\) is the orthogonal matrix of eigenvectors (\(\mathbf{U}^\dagger = \mathbf{U}^{-1}\)),
    \item \(\boldsymbol{\Lambda} = \text{diag}(\lambda_1, \lambda_2, \dots, \lambda_N)\) is the diagonal matrix of eigenvalues.
\end{itemize}

By changing variables to the eigenbasis:
\[
\tilde{\mathbf{r}}(t) = \mathbf{U}^\dagger \mathbf{r}(t),
\]
the equation becomes:
\[
\frac{d \tilde{\mathbf{r}}(t)}{dt} = -\boldsymbol{\Lambda} \tilde{\mathbf{r}}(t) + \tilde{\boldsymbol{\eta}}(t),
\]
where \(\tilde{\boldsymbol{\eta}}(t) = \mathbf{U}^\dagger \boldsymbol{\eta}(t)\). Since the transformation is orthogonal, \(\tilde{\boldsymbol{\eta}}(t)\) remains Gaussian white noise with the same properties as \(\boldsymbol{\eta}(t)\).

\subsection{Decoupled Equation}

The diagonalization decouples the system into independent equations for each mode \(k\):
\[
\frac{d \tilde{r}_k(t)}{dt} = -\lambda_k \tilde{r}_k(t) + \tilde{\eta}_k(t),
\]
where \(\tilde{r}_k(t)\) is the \(k\)-th component of \(\tilde{\mathbf{r}}(t)\), \(\lambda_k\) is the \(k\)-th eigenvalue, and \(\tilde{\eta}_k(t)\) is the \(k\)-th component of the transformed noise.

\subsection{Solution for Each Mode}

The solution to the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck equation for each mode is:
\[
\tilde{r}_k(t) = \tilde{r}_k(0) e^{-\lambda_k t} + \int_0^t e^{-\lambda_k (t-s)} \tilde{\eta}_k(s) \, ds.
\]

\subsection{Transforming Back to Original Basis}

Returning to the original variables:
\[
\mathbf{r}(t) = \mathbf{U} \tilde{\mathbf{r}}(t),
\]
we can write the solution as:
\[
\mathbf{r}(t) = \mathbf{U} \left[ \tilde{\mathbf{r}}(0) e^{-\boldsymbol{\Lambda} t} + \int_0^t e^{-\boldsymbol{\Lambda} (t-s)} \tilde{\boldsymbol{\eta}}(s) \, ds \right].
\]

\subsection {Covariance}
The covariance of \(\mathbf{r}(t)\) is defined as:
\[
\mathbf{C}(t) = \langle \mathbf{r}(t) \mathbf{r}^\top(0) \rangle,
\]
where \(\mathbf{r}(t) = \mathbf{U} \tilde{\mathbf{r}}(t)\). Substituting this into the definition:
\[
\mathbf{C}(t) = \mathbf{U} \langle \tilde{\mathbf{r}}(t) \tilde{\mathbf{r}}^\top(0) \rangle \mathbf{U}^\top.
\]

The solution for \(\tilde{\mathbf{r}}(t)\) is:
\[
\tilde{\mathbf{r}}(t) = \tilde{\mathbf{r}}(0) e^{-\boldsymbol{\Lambda} t} + \int_0^t e^{-\boldsymbol{\Lambda} (t-s)} \tilde{\boldsymbol{\eta}}(s) \, ds.
\]

Substituting this into the covariance:
\[
\langle \tilde{\mathbf{r}}(t) \tilde{\mathbf{r}}^\top(0) \rangle = \langle \tilde{\mathbf{r}}(0) e^{-\boldsymbol{\Lambda} t} \tilde{\mathbf{r}}^\top(0) \rangle + \left\langle \left( \int_0^t e^{-\boldsymbol{\Lambda} (t-s)} \tilde{\boldsymbol{\eta}}(s) \, ds \right) \tilde{\mathbf{r}}^\top(0) \right\rangle.
\]

For the first term:
\[
\langle \tilde{\mathbf{r}}(0) e^{-\boldsymbol{\Lambda} t} \tilde{\mathbf{r}}^\top(0) \rangle = e^{-\boldsymbol{\Lambda} t} \langle \tilde{\mathbf{r}}(0) \tilde{\mathbf{r}}^\top(0) \rangle.
\]

In the stationary regime:
\[
\langle \tilde{r}_k(0) \tilde{r}_l(0) \rangle = \delta_{kl} \frac{k_B T}{\lambda_k}.
\]
Thus:
\[
\langle \tilde{\mathbf{r}}(0) \tilde{\mathbf{r}}^\top(0) \rangle = \boldsymbol{\Lambda}^{-1} \cdot k_B T.
\]

Substitute this into Term 1:
\[
\langle \tilde{\mathbf{r}}(0) e^{-\boldsymbol{\Lambda} t} \tilde{\mathbf{r}}^\top(0) \rangle = e^{-\boldsymbol{\Lambda} t} \cdot \boldsymbol{\Lambda}^{-1} \cdot k_B T.
\]

For the second term:
\[
\left\langle \left( \int_0^t e^{-\boldsymbol{\Lambda} (t-s)} \tilde{\boldsymbol{\eta}}(s) \, ds \right) \tilde{\mathbf{r}}^\top(0) \right\rangle = 0,
\]
because \(\tilde{\boldsymbol{\eta}}(s)\) is uncorrelated with \(\tilde{\mathbf{r}}(0)\).

Thus, the stochastic contribution vanishes.

The covariance in the eigenbasis is:
\[
\langle \tilde{\mathbf{r}}(t) \tilde{\mathbf{r}}^\top(0) \rangle = e^{-\boldsymbol{\Lambda} t} \cdot \boldsymbol{\Lambda}^{-1} \cdot k_B T.
\]

Transform back to the original basis:
\[
\mathbf{C}(t) = \mathbf{U} \langle \tilde{\mathbf{r}}(t) \tilde{\mathbf{r}}^\top(0) \rangle \mathbf{U}^\top.
\]

Substitute the eigenbasis covariance:
\[
\mathbf{C}(t) = \mathbf{U} \left( e^{-\boldsymbol{\Lambda} t} \cdot \boldsymbol{\Lambda}^{-1} \cdot k_B T \right) \mathbf{U}^\top.
\]


In components, the covariance matrix is:
\[
C_{ij}(t) = \sum_{k=1}^N u_{ik} u_{jk} \frac{k_B T}{\lambda_k} e^{-\lambda_k t},
\]
where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \(u_{ik}\) is the \(i\)-th component of the \(k\)-th eigenvector,
    \item \(\lambda_k\) is the \(k\)-th eigenvalue of \(\mathbf{K}\).
\end{itemize}


The covariance matrix in component form is:
\[
C_{ij}(t) = \sum_{k=1}^N \frac{k_B T}{\lambda_k} u_{ik} u_{jk} e^{-\lambda_k t}.
\]



\subsection {Response Function}

The response function \(R_{ij}(t)\) is defined,following \eqref{response}, as:\cite{ref13}

\begin{equation}
    R_{\beta\gamma}(t) = \frac{C_{\beta\gamma}(t)}{C_{\beta\gamma}(0)},
    \end{equation}
    
So it is completely determined by the correlation.
Substituting these into the correlation function:
\[
R_{\beta\gamma}(t) = \frac{\sum_{k=1}^N \frac{k_B T}{\lambda_k} u_{\beta k} u_{\gamma k} e^{-\lambda_k t}}{\sum_{k=1}^N \frac{k_B T}{\lambda_k} u_{\beta k} u_{\gamma k}}.
\]

The factors \(k_B T\) cancel out, so the final expression for \(R_{\beta\gamma}(t)\) is:
\[
R_{\beta\gamma}(t) = \frac{\sum_{k=1}^N \frac{1}{\lambda_k} u_{\beta k} u_{\gamma k} e^{-\lambda_k t}}{\sum_{k=1}^N \frac{1}{\lambda_k} u_{\beta k} u_{\gamma k}}.
\]


\subsection{Transfer Entropy}

The transfer entropy \(TE_{j \to i}(t)\) is defined, following \eqref{TE}, as:
\[
TE_{j \to i}(t) = -\frac{1}{2} \ln{\left(1 - \frac{\alpha_{ij}(t)}{\beta_{ij}(t)}\right)},
\]
so it is completely determined by the correlation.

Using the derived correlation function:
\[
C_{ij}(t) = \sum_{k=1}^N \frac{1}{\lambda_k} u_{ik} u_{jk} e^{-\lambda_k t},
\]
and the initial correlation:
\[
C_{ij}(0) = \sum_{k=1}^N \frac{1}{\lambda_k} u_{ik} u_{jk},
\]
we substitute these into \(\alpha_{ij}(t)\) and \(\beta_{ij}(t)\).

For \(\alpha_{ij}(t)\), substitute \(C_{ii}(0)\), \(C_{ij}(t)\), and \(C_{ij}(0)\):
\[
\alpha_{ij}(t) = \frac{C_{ij}(t)^2}{C_{ii}(0) C_{jj}(0)}.
\]

Using the expressions for \(C_{ij}(t)\) and \(C_{ij}(0)\), we substitute:
\[
C_{ij}(t) = \sum_{k=1}^N \frac{1}{\lambda_k} u_{ik} u_{jk} e^{-\lambda_k t}, \quad
C_{ij}(0) = \sum_{k=1}^N \frac{1}{\lambda_k} u_{ik} u_{jk}.
\]

For \(C_{ii}(0)\) and \(C_{jj}(0)\), set \(\beta = i\) or \(j\) in \(C_{ii}(0)\):
\[
C_{ii}(0) = \sum_{k=1}^N \frac{1}{\lambda_k} u_{ik}^2, \quad
C_{jj}(0) = \sum_{k=1}^N \frac{1}{\lambda_k} u_{jk}^2.
\]

Thus:
\[
\alpha_{ij}(t) = \frac{\left(\sum_{k=1}^N \frac{1}{\lambda_k} u_{ik} u_{jk} e^{-\lambda_k t}\right)^2}
{\left(\sum_{k=1}^N \frac{1}{\lambda_k} u_{ik}^2\right)\left(\sum_{k=1}^N \frac{1}{\lambda_k} u_{jk}^2\right)}.
\]

For \(\beta_{ij}(t)\), the definition is:
\[
\beta_{ij}(t) = \frac{C_{ii}(0) C_{jj}(0) - C_{ij}(t)^2}{C_{ii}(0) C_{jj}(0)}.
\]

Substituting the expressions for \(C_{ii}(0)\), \(C_{jj}(0)\), and \(C_{ij}(t)\), we get:
\[
\beta_{ij}(t) = 1 - \frac{\left(\sum_{k=1}^N \frac{1}{\lambda_k} u_{ik} u_{jk} e^{-\lambda_k t}\right)^2}
{\left(\sum_{k=1}^N \frac{1}{\lambda_k} u_{ik}^2\right)\left(\sum_{k=1}^N \frac{1}{\lambda_k} u_{jk}^2\right)}.
\]

Substituting \(\alpha_{ij}(t)\) and \(\beta_{ij}(t)\) into the formula for \(TE_{j \to i}(t)\):
\[
TE_{j \to i}(t) = -\frac{1}{2} \ln{\left(1 - \frac{\frac{\left(\sum_{k=1}^N \frac{1}{\lambda_k} u_{ik} u_{jk} e^{-\lambda_k t}\right)^2}
{\left(\sum_{k=1}^N \frac{1}{\lambda_k} u_{ik}^2\right)\left(\sum_{k=1}^N \frac{1}{\lambda_k} u_{jk}^2\right)}}
{1 - \frac{\left(\sum_{k=1}^N \frac{1}{\lambda_k} u_{ik} u_{jk} e^{-\lambda_k t}\right)^2}
{\left(\sum_{k=1}^N \frac{1}{\lambda_k} u_{ik}^2\right)\left(\sum_{k=1}^N \frac{1}{\lambda_k} u_{jk}^2\right)}}\right)}.

\section{Detailed Presentation of Dataset 3LNX}

\noindent The 3LNX corresponds to a photoswitchable PDZ domain engineered to undergo light-induced conformational changes.\\
This protein system incorporates an azobenzene-based photoswitch, enabling a reversible transition between distinct conformational states upon specific illumination conditions. \\
Such light-triggered isomerization events alter the protein’s fold, side-chain orientations, and overall dynamic properties, ultimately influencing the protein’s binding capabilities and functional behavior.

The structure of 3LNX was determined using solution-phase NMR spectroscopy, providing a detailed ensemble of conformations that represent the domain under defined conditions. 

The conformational states observed in the 3LNX dataset span a range of structural compactness and side-chain packing arrangements.  
By analyzing these fluctuations between states, researchers gain insight into the dynamic landscape that underpins the protein’s functional transitions and understand how external stimuli (in this case, light) can guide the conformational equilibrium.

Overall, the 3LNX dataset serves as a fundamental reference point for studying light-responsive protein conformational changes.

\end{figure}

\noindent\textbf{Structural Highlights:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Overall Structure}: The PDZ domain of 3LNX contains multiple $\beta$-strands and $\alpha$-helices that create a canonical PDZ fold, complete with a characteristic ligand-binding groove.
    \item \textbf{Atomic Representation}: The azobenzene derivative is covalently attached, acting as a molecular photoswitch. Its isomerization influences the positioning of surrounding residues and the backbone conformation.
    \item \textbf{Functional Elements}: The ligand-binding groove is visible, providing insight into how photoswitching might modulate binding events by altering groove shape, depth, and accessibility.
\end{itemize}

\section{Connection Radius}\label{connection_radius}

\noindent A critical aspect of analyzing 3LNX’s structural data is the choice of the connection radius when constructing the Kirchhoff matrix. 
This matrix forms the basis of GNM and is widely used to probe the collective motions within proteins.
By selecting an appropriate connection radius, one captures both local and long-range interactions between residues, ensuring that the resulting network accurately reflects the protein’s mechanical and dynamic properties.

It is common in litterature to take a value for the connection radius $\tilde{x} \approx \frac{1}{2} x^*, \text{ dove } x^* \text{ è tale che } f''(x) \big|_{x = x^*}$ = 0. In our case we took the value of 8.0 nm.\\

\section{Kirchhoff Matrix}\label{Kirchhoff_paragraph}
\noindent Applying \eqref{Kirchhoff} to the protein structure, we obtain the Kirchhoff matrix \(\mathbf{K}\) for the system. This matrix captures the connectivity between residues and provides insights into the protein's structural dynamics. 
We choose to put the value of the link between two native pair (near neighbor), equal to 20, otherwise the link is equal to 1.
So:
Let \( G = (V, E) \) be a graph where \( V \) is the set of vertices and \( E \) is the set of edges. Define the weight of the link between two vertices \( i \) and \( j \) as \( w(i, j) \).

We assign weights as follows:
\[
w(i, j) =
\begin{cases}
20, & \text{if } i \text{ and } j \text{ are near neighbors}, \\
1, & \text{otherwise}.
\end{cases}
\]
The chosen weights are based on the relative importance of interactions in the context of protein stability and structural dynamics:
\paragraph{Near-neighbor interactions (native pairs):} \\
\textbf{Physical Basis:} Near neighbors are typically connected by strong covalent bonds or stabilized by dense non-covalent interactions (e.g., van der Waals forces, hydrogen bonds). These interactions dominate the local stability and rigidity of the protein structure.\\

\textbf{Quantitative Support:} The energy contributions from covalent bonds (300–400 kJ/mol) and closely packed van der Waals interactions are significantly higher than those from distant or weaker interactions.\\

\textbf{Weight Selection:} By assigning a weight of 20, we prioritize the influence of these dominant interactions in the Kirchhoff matrix. This ensures that the matrix reflects the critical role of local connectivity in determining the protein's overall structural stability.\\
\\
\paragraph{Distant interactions:}
\textbf{Physical Basis:} Residues that are not near neighbors may still interact through long-range forces (e.g., electrostatic or weak van der Waals forces). However, these interactions are generally less frequent and contribute less to the rigidity of the protein.

\textbf{Weight Selection:} Assigning a lower weight of 1 acknowledges the reduced importance of these interactions while still accounting for their presence in the protein network.
\begin{figure}[h!]

    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{/Users/enrico/PROTEINS/tesi/immagini_tesi_ingelse/Matrice di Kirchhoff della Proteina.png}
    \caption{Kirchoff Matrix.}
\end{figure}
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

We notice first that as expected the Kirchhoff matrix is symmetric and that the diagonal elements are all negative. This is consistent with the physical interpretation of the matrix, where the diagonal elements represent the sum of the coupling strengths between a residue and all other residues in the protein. The negative sign indicates that the interactions are stabilizing, as expected in a protein structure. The off-diagonal elements represent the coupling between pairs of residues, reflecting the network of interactions that stabilize the protein's structure.
It is important to notice also that most of the links are between near residues, but we have also some cluster of links between distant residues. This is important because it means that the protein is not a simple chain of residues but it is a complex network of interactions.

\section{Correlation Matrix}
\noindent The two figures illustrate the correlation matrices obtained from the protein structure. The elements of the matrix represent correlations between residues \(i\) and \(j\), derived from the dynamics and structure of the system. Overlaying the secondary structure (Helices: red; Beta Sheets: blue) helps to contextualize the correlations within structural motifs. The Kirchhoff matrix was used to compute these correlations.
\begin{figure}[h!]

    \caption{Negative covariance between residues at time 0.}

\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{/Users/enrico/PROTEINS/tesi/immagini_tesi_ingelse/Correlation_MatrixNan_True.png}
    \caption{Positive covariance between residues at time 0.}
    \label{fig:correlation_positive_figo}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Figure Analysis:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{First Plot \ref{fig:correlation_negative_figo}: Correlation Matrix:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The red box highlights a region of strong local correlations, likely associated with tightly coupled residues within a helix or beta sheet structure.
        \item The light background suggests weak or negligible correlations outside the main diagonal and the highlighted regions, reflecting weaker interactions or dynamic decoupling.
        \item The diagonal dominance indicates strong correlations between residues within the same structural domain.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Second Plot \ref{fig:correlation_positive_figo}: Correlation Matrix:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The overall structure appears more diffuse, with non-local correlations extending further from the diagonal.
        \item The red box again highlights a region of strong correlations, consistent with a structural motif (helix or beta sheet).
        \item The increased blue intensity in some regions may suggest the inclusion of weak, long-range interactions due to the handling of missing values (NaNs as True).
        \item Differences in the correlation intensity compared to the first plot reflect the impact of NaN handling on the computation of the correlation matrix.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Relation to the Kirchhoff Matrix:}
The Kirchhoff matrix directly influences the correlation matrices by encoding the connectivity between residues. 
\begin{itemize}
    \item The strong correlations in the highlighted regions correspond to residues with high connectivity in the Kirchhoff matrix (near neighbors with weights of 20).
    \item Weaker correlations in the off-diagonal regions are consistent with weaker weights (1) assigned to distant interactions in the Kirchhoff matrix.
\end{itemize}



\newpage
\section{Beta Factors}
\noindent The plot above compares the experimental \( B \)-factors (blue curve), as we said in \eqref{beta} $B_i = 8\pi^2 C_{ii}$, with the predicted \( B \)-factors (red curve) along the residue index. The \( B \)-factors, which represent the atomic displacement or flexibility, are a critical measure of the dynamic behavior of the protein structure.
\paragraph{Analysis:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Experimental \( B \)-factors (blue curve):}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The blue curve shows regions of higher flexibility (peaks) and rigidity (troughs) as derived from experimental data.
        \item Peaks in the \( B \)-factors align with regions of loops or exposed residues, typically more flexible regions.
        \item Troughs align with structured regions such as helices or beta sheets, which are inherently more rigid.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Predicted \( B \)-factors (red curve):}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The predicted \( B \)-factors generally follow the experimental trend, demonstrating the effectiveness of the model in capturing the dynamics of the protein.
        \item Discrepancies between the predicted and experimental curves are visible in certain regions, particularly near residues with extreme flexibility or rigidity. These deviations may be due to limitations in the Kirchhoff matrix approximation or oversimplified assumptions in the modeling process.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
Using formula of section \ref{sec:Evaluation}, we can evaluate the model performance by calculating the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) between the predicted and experimental \( B \)-factors. 
These metrics provide a quantitative assessment of the model's accuracy in capturing the protein's dynamic behavior.
\begin{table}[h!]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
    \hline
    \textbf{Metric} & \textbf{Value} \\ \hline
    RMSE & 8.5200 \\ \hline
    MAE  & 6.4146 \\ \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Model Performance Metrics}
    \label{tab:model_metrics}
\end{table}




\paragraph{Secondary Structure Context:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The background shading (red and blue bands) indicates secondary structure elements:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Red regions:} Helices, characterized by lower \( B \)-factors and greater rigidity.
        \item \textbf{Blue regions:} Beta sheets, which also exhibit lower \( B \)-factors compared to loops but slightly higher flexibility than helices.
    \end{itemize}
    \item The alignment of peaks and troughs in the \( B \)-factor curves with these shaded regions provides structural context to the observed dynamics.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Model Implications:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The good agreement between experimental and predicted \( B \)-factors in structured regions (helices and beta sheets) supports the validity of the Kirchhoff matrix-based model.
    \item Discrepancies in loop regions suggest that additional factors, such as long-range interactions or local disorder, might need to be incorporated into the model for improved accuracy.
\end{itemize}

This analysis highlights the capability of the Kirchhoff matrix to predict protein flexibility while identifying areas for potential refinement.

    \item \textbf{Overview:} This graph presents the time-dependent correlation for selected residue pairs.
    \item \textbf{Key Observations:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The correlations decay over time, indicating a loss of direct dynamic influence as time progresses.
        \item The initial correlation values vary significantly between residue pairs, reflecting differences in their initial dynamic coupling.
        \item Residue pairs closer in space (e.g., neighboring residues) tend to show higher initial correlations compared to more distant pairs.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Dynamic Implications:} The decay patterns suggest that short-range interactions dominate in the initial time steps, while longer timescales reflect broader structural dynamics.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Graph 2: Responses in Time}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Overview:} This graph illustrates the time response of the selected residue pairs following a perturbation.
    \item \textbf{Key Observations:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The responses exhibit a sharp rise initially, which is then followed by a gradual decay.
        \item Residue pairs closer to the source of perturbation (likely spatially proximal) show a more pronounced and faster response.
        \item The decay rate varies across residue pairs, with some exhibiting sustained responses while others rapidly stabilize.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Overview:} This graph captures the transfer entropy as a function of time, quantifying the directional information transfer between residue pairs.
    \item \textbf{Key Observations:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item A peak is observed at an intermediate time point for most residue pairs, indicating a time of maximum information transfer.
        \item The magnitude of transfer entropy varies, reflecting differences in the strength of directional coupling between pairs.
        \item Residue pairs with high initial connectivity (likely closer in the protein structure) exhibit stronger peaks compared to those that are more distant.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Dynamic Implications:} The transfer entropy peak provides a measure of the optimal timescale for information flow within the protein. Residue pairs with sustained directional coupling are likely critical for allosteric communication.

\section{Causal indicators between residues}
\subsection{characteristic time determination}
To analyze our system, it is essential to focus on timescales around the \textit{characteristic time} \(\tau\). 
If the time \(t\) is too small, the dynamics of the system cannot be observed effectively. Conversely, if \(t\) is too large, the relaxation behavior of the system becomes indistinguishable.

We can determine the characteristic time \(\tau\) of the system using the following algorithm:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Compute the autocorrelation function \(C_{i,i}(t)\) for all available times \(t\).
    \item Identify, for each \(i\), the time \(t_i\) such that 
    \[
    C_{i,i}(t_i) = e^{-1} C_{i,i}(0),
    \]
    where \(C_{i,i}(0)\) represents the initial autocorrelation value.
    \item Calculate the mean of all \(t_i\). This mean value represents the characteristic time \(\tau\) of the system:
    \[
    \tau = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} t_i.
    \]
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Correlation between residues}
\noindent The dynamic interplay between the beta sheet and the helix is quantitatively evident across all figures. The beta sheet stabilizes the protein through localized rigidity and strong intra-regional dynamics, while the helix introduces flexibility and facilitates long-range communication. These complementary roles are essential for balancing the stability and functional adaptability of the protein structure.

\subsubsection{Graphic analysis of correlation}
The figures provide a detailed view of the dynamic properties of the protein structure, focusing on the beta sheet around residue ~21 and the alpha helix near residue ~76. These secondary structures exhibit distinct dynamical behaviors, which are quantified using metrics such as inverse first mean time, correlation, response, and transfer entropy.
\paragraph{Figure \ref{fig:corr21}: Correlation with Residue ~21}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Beta Sheet Region (Residue ~21):} Strong correlation values are observed in this region, reflecting the tightly coupled dynamics among the residues in the beta sheet. These high correlations are a direct consequence of the stabilizing hydrogen bonds that link the beta strands, enforcing collective motion within this region.
    \item \textbf{Alpha Helix Region (Residue ~76):} Moderate correlation values in the helix region suggest that residues near residue 76 are influenced by, but less directly connected to, the beta sheet. The helix's intrinsic flexibility reduces the strength of its correlation with the beta sheet residues.
    \item \textbf{Interpretation:} This figure emphasizes the beta sheet's role as a hub of strong dynamic interactions, anchoring the protein’s motion. The helix, while dynamically active, plays a more peripheral role in interacting with the beta sheet.
\end{itemize}
\paragraph{Figure \ref{fig:corr40}: Correlation with Residue ~40}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Beta Sheet Region (Residue ~21):} Strong correlation values are observed in this region, reflecting the tightly coupled dynamics among the residues in the beta sheet. These high correlations are a direct consequence of the stabilizing hydrogen bonds that link the beta strands, enforcing collective motion within this region.
    \item \textbf{Beta Sheet Region (Residue ~40):} Strong correlation values are observed in this region, reflecting the tightly coupled dynamics among the residues in the beta sheet. These high correlations are a direct consequence of the stabilizing hydrogen bonds that link the beta strands, enforcing collective motion within this region.
    \item \textbf{Alpha Helix Region (Residue ~76):} Strong correlation values in the helix region suggest that residues near residue 76 are influenced by, but less directly connected to, the beta sheet. The helix's intrinsic flexibility reduces the strength of its correlation with the beta sheet residues.
    \item \textbf{Interpretation:} This figure emphasizes the beta sheet's role as a hub of strong dynamic interactions, anchoring the protein’s motion. The helix, while dynamically active, plays a more peripheral role in interacting with the beta sheet.
\end{itemize}
\paragraph{Figure \ref{fig:corr76}: Correlation with Residue ~76}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Beta Sheet Region (Residue ~21):} Lower correlation values between the beta sheet and residue 76 indicate that the beta sheet's rigidity limits its dynamic communication with the helix. This suggests that the beta sheet’s motion is more self-contained, reducing its coupling to distant regions like the helix.
    \item \textbf{Alpha Helix Region (Residue ~76):} High correlation values around residue 76 highlight the helix's central role in propagating dynamic signals within the protein. These correlations reflect the helix’s ability to communicate dynamically with both nearby residues and more distant regions.
    \item \textbf{Interpretation:} The helix serves as a dynamic mediator, interacting more strongly with distant residues compared to the beta sheet. This figure underscores the helix’s flexibility and its role in bridging different structural regions of the protein.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Conclusion}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Correlation and Response Patterns:} Perturbations at residue 21 lead to noticeable correlations and dynamic responses in the regions surrounding residues 38, 43, and 76. This suggests that the signal propagates through a structured network of residues.
    \item \textbf{Transfer Entropy:} The directional flow of dynamic information, as seen in the transfer entropy plots, reveals significant communication: 
    \[
    \text{Beta sheet (21)} \rightarrow \text{Intermediate residues (38, 43)} \rightarrow \text{Alpha helix (76)}.
    \]
    Additionally, there is evidence of bidirectional transfer, indicating that these regions are dynamically coupled.
\end{itemize}

The observed communication supports a plausible \textit{allosteric mechanism}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The \textbf{beta sheet near residue 21} may act as an \textit{allosteric trigger}, initiating perturbations or signals due to its rigid and stable structure.
    \item The residues between the \textbf{beta sheet (38)} and the \textbf{alpha helix (43)} serve as \textit{transmission pathways}, efficiently relaying signals.
    \item The \textbf{alpha helix near residue 76}, due to its flexibility, can amplify and propagate the signal over longer distances, potentially influencing distant functional regions.
\end{itemize}

This dynamic interplay between beta sheets and alpha helices highlights a hierarchical communication process that balances \textbf{stability} and \textbf{flexibility}. Such mechanisms are essential for:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Enabling long-range signal propagation within the protein,
    \item Facilitating \textbf{allosteric regulation}, where local perturbations influence distant functional sites,
    \item Supporting structural adaptability critical for \textbf{ligand binding}, \textbf{signal transduction}, or \textbf{enzymatic activity}.
\end{itemize}



\subsection*{Betweenness Centrality and Bridge Residues}

Betweenness centrality is a fundamental measure in graph theory that quantifies the importance of a node in terms of its ability to act as a ``bridge'' for communication between other nodes in a network. Mathematically, the betweenness centrality \( C_B(v) \) of a node \( v \) is defined as:

\[
C_B(v) = \sum_{s \neq v \neq t} \frac{\sigma_{st}(v)}{\sigma_{st}},
\]
where \( \sigma_{st} \) is the total number of shortest paths between nodes \( s \) and \( t \), and \( \sigma_{st}(v) \) is the number of those paths that pass through node \( v \).

In the context of protein structure, residues are represented as nodes in a graph, and edges represent interactions or dynamic correlations between residues. Nodes (residues) with high betweenness centrality lie on a large fraction of the shortest paths connecting other residues and are critical for **mediating communication** between different regions of the protein.

To compute \( \sigma_{st} \) and \( \sigma_{st}(v) \), we use the **Brandes algorithm**, which is the most efficient method for calculating betweenness centrality. The algorithm operates as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item For each node \( s \) in the graph, compute the number of shortest paths \( \sigma_{st} \) from \( s \) to all other nodes \( t \) using a **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** for unweighted graphs or **Dijkstra's algorithm** for weighted graphs.
    \item Backtrack from the destination nodes to the source node to identify which intermediate nodes contribute to the shortest paths and accumulate the number of paths \( \sigma_{st}(v) \) that pass through each node \( v \).
    \item Aggregate the contributions of all source nodes \( s \) to compute the final betweenness centrality \( C_B(v) \) for each node \( v \).

The **Brandes algorithm** has a time complexity of \( O(VE) \) for unweighted graphs and \( O(VE + V^2 \log V) \) for weighted graphs, where \( V \) is the number of nodes and \( E \) is the number of edges. This efficiency makes it feasible to apply the algorithm to large protein graphs.

High betweenness centrality values indicate that a residue acts as a **dynamic bridge** or connector, facilitating the flow of information or perturbations between structurally or functionally distinct regions of the protein. For example, residues with high centrality might connect beta sheets and alpha helices, enabling the propagation of signals across the protein. This property is particularly significant in the study of **allosteric mechanisms**, where perturbations at one site influence distant functional regions. In such cases, residues with high betweenness centrality serve as key intermediaries for signal transmission, linking otherwise distant parts of the protein network.

Thus, betweenness centrality provides a powerful computational tool for uncovering residues that play central roles in the **structural dynamics** and **functional communication** of proteins.

As e said before correlation is only a necessary condition for causation but not sufficient. So we will search futher to indentified causation.

\section*{Introduzione}
L'obiettivo dello studio era analizzare le **correlazioni dinamiche** tra i residui della proteina PDZ, identificando connessioni funzionali tra diverse strutture secondarie. L'analisi si concentra su specifici residui chiave:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{i=33}: situato nella \textit{\ensuremath{\alpha}A-helix}.
    \item \textbf{i=45}: situato nella \textit{\ensuremath{\alpha}A-helix} e core \ensuremath{\beta}.
    \item \textbf{i=72}: situato nella \textit{\ensuremath{\alpha}B-helix}.
\end{itemize}
Le correlazioni sono state analizzate rispetto a tutte le altre regioni della proteina, con un focus sulle risposte nelle seguenti aree funzionali:
\begin{itemize}
    \item La **tasca di legame**: \ensuremath{\beta2}-strand, \ensuremath{\alpha1}-helix e CBL.
    \item Il **core \ensuremath{\beta}**: foglietti \ensuremath{\beta2}, \ensuremath{\beta3} e \ensuremath{\beta4}.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Risultati e Discussione}

    \item \textbf{Correlazioni secondarie}: Si osservano risposte moderate nei foglietti \ensuremath{\beta2} e nella regione \ensuremath{\alpha}B-helix.
    \item \textbf{Cosa funziona}: Le correlazioni mostrano una connessione dinamica locale e una trasmissione parziale al core \ensuremath{\beta}.
    \item \textbf{Cosa manca}: Le correlazioni verso la **tasca di legame** (\ensuremath{\alpha1}-helix e \ensuremath{\beta2}-strand) sono deboli e meno pronunciate rispetto alle attese.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{2. Correlazione con i=45 (\ensuremath{\alpha}A-helix e core \ensuremath{\beta})}
\begin{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Cosa funziona}: La connessione tra **\ensuremath{\alpha}A-helix** e il core \ensuremath{\beta} \`e evidente, con una parziale propagazione verso la tasca di legame.
    \item \textbf{Cosa manca}: Le correlazioni nella **\ensuremath{\alpha1}-helix** rimangono limitate, suggerendo una trasmissione incompleta alla tasca di legame.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{3. Correlazione con i=72 (\ensuremath{\alpha}B-helix)}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Correlazione osservata}: Picco netto di correlazione intorno a **i=72** (\ensuremath{\alpha}B-helix).
    \item \textbf{Correlazioni secondarie}: Risposte evidenti nelle regioni della **tasca di legame** (\ensuremath{\beta2}-strand e \ensuremath{\alpha1}-helix).
    \item \textbf{Cosa funziona}: La connessione dinamica tra la \ensuremath{\alpha}B-helix e la tasca di legame \`e ben evidenziata, con correlazioni significative e coerenti.
    \item \textbf{Cosa manca}: Correlazioni deboli nel core \ensuremath{\beta} (foglietti \ensuremath{\beta3} e \ensuremath{\beta4}), suggerendo una trasmissione parziale.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Conclusioni}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Le correlazioni con **i=72** (\ensuremath{\alpha}B-helix) mostrano la connessione pi\`u forte con la **tasca di legame**, confermando la sua importanza allosterica.
    \item Le correlazioni con **i=33** e **i=45** (\ensuremath{\alpha}A-helix) evidenziano risposte locali e parziali nel core \ensuremath{\beta}, ma sono meno pronunciate nelle regioni periferiche.
    \item La **tasca di legame** (\ensuremath{\beta2}-strand e \ensuremath{\alpha1}-helix) risponde chiaramente alle correlazioni con \ensuremath{\alpha}B-helix, ma mostra correlazioni deboli con \ensuremath{\alpha}A-helix.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Prospettive future}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Approfondire le **correlazioni dinamiche** con metodi a risoluzione temporale pi\`u alta per chiarire la trasmissione nel core \ensuremath{\beta}.
    \item Analizzare ulteriormente la **\ensuremath{\alpha}C-helix** per verificare il suo potenziale ruolo nella propagazione delle correlazioni.
    \item Studiare interazioni residue-residue specifiche per identificare nodi chiave nella rete allosterica.

\subsubsection{Graphic analysis of response}
\paragraph{Figure \ref{fig:resp21} : Response with Residue ~21
}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Beta Sheet Region (Residue ~21):} The response values around residue 21 show a sharp peak, consistent with the beta sheet's stabilizing influence on the protein's dynamics. The high response values highlight the beta sheet’s role in shaping the local dynamic environment.
    \item \textbf{Alpha Helix Region (Residue ~76):} In the helix region, the response to residue 21 is weaker, indicating that the helix dynamics are less directly influenced by the beta sheet. The helix's intrinsic flexibility decouples it from the rigid motions of the beta sheet.
    \item \textbf{Interpretation:} The beta sheet acts as a localized stabilizing force, with its influence tapering off in regions like the helix. This behavior supports the protein's need for both localized rigidity and broader adaptability.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Role of Protein Secondary Structures in Stability and Communication}

Protein secondary structures, such as beta sheets and alpha helices, play distinct and complementary roles in maintaining structural integrity and facilitating communication within the protein. Their unique features contribute to the balance between stability and flexibility, which is essential for proper protein function.

Beta sheets, characterized by their planar and extended conformation, are known to stabilize the protein structure. This stability arises from the strong hydrogen bonding networks between adjacent beta strands, which result in pronounced local correlations. These correlations create a tightly packed and rigid framework, enabling efficient intraregional communication. Furthermore, the acute responses observed in beta sheets suggest that this rigidity supports precise local adaptations to environmental or structural changes without compromising the overall integrity of the protein. As a result, beta sheets are crucial for maintaining localized stability and ensuring robust communication within their immediate surroundings.

On the other hand, alpha helices are distinguished by their helical structure, which is stabilized by intramolecular hydrogen bonds between residues that are spaced four amino acids apart. Unlike beta sheets, alpha helices introduce a greater degree of dynamic flexibility into the protein structure. This flexibility enables the protein to adapt to conformational changes and to transmit information over longer distances. The correlations and responses observed in alpha helices are less concentrated compared to those in beta sheets, reflecting their role in facilitating long-range communication rather than localized stability. This property is particularly important in regions of the protein where dynamic interactions with other molecules or conformational shifts are required for functional activity.

An analysis based on transfer entropy further emphasizes the contrasting roles of these secondary structures. Perturbations introduced within beta sheet regions tend to have highly localized effects, primarily influencing nearby residues due to their rigid and tightly packed arrangement. In contrast, perturbations in alpha helices exhibit a broader impact, propagating signals to more distant residues. This suggests that alpha helices act as conduits for information transfer across different regions of the protein, thereby supporting long-range coordination and dynamic responses to environmental stimuli.

In summary, beta sheets and alpha helices exhibit complementary roles in protein function. While beta sheets contribute to structural rigidity, local stability, and precise intraregional communication, alpha helices provide the necessary flexibility and facilitate the transmission of information across larger distances. Together, these secondary structures enable proteins to maintain a delicate balance between stability and adaptability, which is essential for their diverse biological functions.

\section{Conclusions of equlibrium stochastic process}
The analysis of residue correlations, dynamic responses, and transfer entropy not only provides a detailed description of internal dynamic interactions but also highlights critical elements of allostericity and key residues that govern protein function. These observations shed light on the functional interplay between the main secondary structural regions: the beta sheet and the alpha helix.

\subsection{Allostericity in the Protein}

\textbf{Role of the beta sheet:} The beta sheet, centered around residue ~21, acts as a local allosteric hub. Its strong internal correlations and confined information flow suggest that this region stabilizes the global structure, while its communication with other regions, such as the alpha helix, remains limited. However, dynamic responses show that even local perturbations in the beta sheet can have attenuated effects on distant regions.

\textbf{Role of the alpha helix:} The alpha helix, centered around residue ~76, functions as an allosteric mediator. High dynamic responses and transfer entropy indicate that this region is particularly effective in propagating dynamic signals across the protein, making it crucial for long-range communication.

\subsection{Identification of Key Allosteric Regions}

The analysis reveals how the beta sheet and alpha helix cooperate to modulate allosteric behavior:

\textbf{Beta sheet (~residue 21):}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Strong, localized correlations.
    \item High control of local dynamics, reducing signal transmission to other regions.
    \item \textit{Key residues involved:} 18–22, which are the primary contributors to the stability of the beta sheet region.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Alpha helix (~residue 76):}
\begin{itemize}
    \item High dynamic response to local perturbations.
    \item Ability to propagate signals dynamically across the protein.
    \item \textit{Key residues involved:} 72–78, which act as key mediators in dynamic communication processes.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Allosteric Interactions Between Beta Sheet and Alpha Helix}

The interplay between these secondary structures is a concrete example of allosteric mechanisms:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Beta sheet as a static anchor:} Provides local rigidity and a stable reference point for protein dynamics.
    \item \textbf{Alpha helix as a dynamic transmitter:} Amplifies dynamic signals and ensures the adaptability needed to respond to both local and global perturbations.
    \item \textbf{Limited but significant connectivity:} Although the beta sheet and alpha helix are dynamically distinct, their allosteric interactions allow fundamental coordination for protein function.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Functional Implications and Allosteric Role}

\begin{itemize}
    \item The cooperation between the beta sheet and the alpha helix balances the stability and flexibility required for effective biological function.
    \item The beta sheet, with its rigid and localized behavior, preserves structural integrity, while the alpha helix facilitates dynamic transitions and responses to the surrounding environment.
    \item This complementary dynamic is indicative of allosteric behavior, where local perturbations (e.g., ligand binding or conformational changes) can influence distant regions, enhancing functional control efficiency.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{General Conclusion}

The analysis demonstrates that the beta sheet and alpha helix are not merely secondary structural components but complementary dynamic and functional elements that are fundamental to protein allostericity. The beta sheet serves as a stabilizing hub, while the alpha helix acts as a flexible transmitter, enabling the protein system to integrate stability and dynamism. This cooperation represents the core of the protein's allosteric behavior and provides valuable insights for understanding and modulating its function.

\chapter{Out-of-Equilibrium Stochastic Processes Induced by Heat Gradients}


The study of protein dynamics under non-equilibrium conditions, such as those induced by a heat gradient, provides valuable insights into how biological systems respond to external perturbations. It also sheds light on their ability to preserve structural integrity and functionality under stress. Investigating protein behavior in non-equilibrium environments helps us understand the influence of thermal fluctuations on dynamic properties, such as flexibility and allosteric interactions.

Allostery, a fundamental property of proteins that underpins their regulatory mechanisms, is often thought to emerge predominantly under non-equilibrium conditions. Therefore, analyzing protein dynamics within this framework is crucial for capturing the nuanced ways in which thermal and environmental gradients affect their function.
\newpage
\section{Stochastic Dynamics Under a Heat Gradient}

In the equilibrium phase, as discussed in Chapter~\ref{chap:stochastic_processes}, the evolution of a system can be described by the stochastic differential equation:
\begin{equation}
    \gamma \frac{dX_t}{dt} = -\nabla H(X_t) + \sqrt{2 \gamma k_B T} \eta_t,
\end{equation}
where the terms are defined as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( X_t \): the state of the system at time \( t \),
    \item \( H(X_t) \): the Hamiltonian function that governs the deterministic behavior of the system,
    \item \( \nabla H(X_t) \): the gradient of the Hamiltonian, representing the deterministic forces acting on the system,
    \item \( \eta_t \): a stochastic noise term modeled as Gaussian white noise with zero mean and variance \( \sigma^2 \), such that \( \langle \eta_t \eta_{t'} \rangle = \sigma^2 \delta(t-t') \),
    \item \( \gamma \): the friction coefficient, which characterizes the dissipation of energy due to interactions with the environment,
    \item \( k_B \): Boltzmann's constant, which links temperature and energy,
    \item \( T \): the temperature of the environment, influencing the amplitude of thermal fluctuations.
\end{itemize}

In a system subjected to a heat gradient, the temperature varies spatially across the protein structure, with each residue experiencing a local temperature \( T(x) \) that depends on its position. This introduces a non-equilibrium condition driven by spatially dependent thermal fluctuations. Consequently, the motion equation is modified to account for this temperature gradient:
\begin{equation}
    \gamma \frac{dX_t}{dt} = -\nabla H(X_t) + B \eta_t, \label{out_eq}
\end{equation}
where \( B \) is a diagonal matrix that incorporates the temperature of each residue. Specifically, \( B = \sqrt{2 \gamma k_B T(x)} \), making the noise term position-dependent.

For simplicity, let us assume the following parameter values:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( \gamma = 0.5 \, \text{s}^{-1} \), 
    \item \( k_B = 1 \, \text{J/K} \), 
    \item \( T(x) \): takes only two discrete values, representing two distinct thermal states.
\end{itemize}

Under these assumptions, the equation simplifies to:
\begin{equation}
    \frac{dX_t}{dt} = -\mathbf{K} \mathbf{X}_t + B \eta_t,
\end{equation}
where \( B \) is further refined to account for the discrete temperature values by incorporating a Kronecker delta function. This function ensures that the temperature contributions to \( B \) are selected appropriately for each residue:
\begin{equation}
    B = \delta_{i,j} \cdot \sqrt{T(x)}.
\end{equation}

This model enables a detailed exploration of the stochastic dynamics of proteins under non-equilibrium conditions, offering a framework to quantify how spatial thermal gradients impact their structural and functional behavior.
\newpage
\section{Solution stochastic dynamics under a heat gradient}
We start from the original equation:
\[
\frac{dX_t}{dt} = -K X_t + B \eta_t.
\]

Substituting \(X_t = U Q_t\), we obtain:
\[
\frac{d(U Q_t)}{dt} = -K (U Q_t) + B \eta_t.
\]

Expanding the left-hand side:
\[
\frac{d(U Q_t)}{dt} = U \frac{dQ_t}{dt},
\]
because \(U\) is constant.

Substituting \(K = U \Lambda U^\top\), the term \(-K(U Q_t)\) becomes:
\[
-K(U Q_t) = -U \Lambda U^\top (U Q_t).
\]
Since \(U^\top U = I\) (orthogonality of \(U\)), the term simplifies to:
\[
- U \Lambda Q_t.
\]

The equation becomes:
\[
U \frac{dQ_t}{dt} = -U \Lambda Q_t + B \eta_t.
\]
Multiplying both sides by \(U^\top\) (to return to the eigenvector space):
\[
\frac{dQ_t}{dt} = -\Lambda Q_t + U^\top B \eta_t.
\]

We write this equation in components. For each component \(i\), we have:
\[
\frac{dQ_{i,t}}{dt} = -\lambda_i Q_{i,t} + \sum_j U_{ji}^\top B_{jj} \eta_{j,t}.
\]
The deterministic term \(-\lambda_i Q_{i,t}\) describes the evolution of the components \(Q_{i,t}\) under the influence of the eigenvalue \(\lambda_i\).

The stochastic term \(\sum_j U_{ji}^\top B_{jj} \eta_{j,t}\) represents the effect of noise transformed in the eigenvector space, with residual couplings arising from \(B\) and \(U\).

Now integrating both sides from \(-\infty\) to \(t\), we have:
\[
Q_{i,t} = \int_{-\infty}^t \left( -\lambda_i Q_{i,\tau} + \sum_j U_{ji}^\top B_{jj} \eta_{j,\tau} \right) d\tau.
\]

Using an integrating factor \(e^{\lambda_i t}\), the equation becomes:
\[
e^{\lambda_i t} Q_{i,t} = \int_{-\infty}^t e^{\lambda_i \tau} \sum_j U_{ji}^\top B_{jj} \eta_{j,\tau} \, d\tau.
\]

Simplifying, the solution is:
\[
Q_{i,t} = \int_{-\infty}^t e^{-\lambda_i (t - \tau)} \sum_j U_{ji}^\top B_{jj} \eta_{j,\tau} \, d\tau.
\]

We now compute the correlation:
\[
\langle Q_i(t) Q_j(s) \rangle = \left\langle \int_{-\infty}^t e^{-\lambda_i (t - \tau)} \sum_k U_{ki}^\top B_{kk} \eta_{k,\tau} \, d\tau \, \int_{-\infty}^s e^{-\lambda_j (s - \tau')} \sum_l U_{lj}^\top B_{ll} \eta_{l,\tau'} \, d\tau' \right\rangle.
\]

Expanding, we get:
\[
\langle Q_i(t) Q_j(s) \rangle = \int_{-\infty}^t \int_{-\infty}^s e^{-\lambda_i (t - \tau)} e^{-\lambda_j (s - \tau')} \sum_k \sum_l U_{ki}^\top B_{kk} U_{lj}^\top B_{ll} \langle \eta_{k,\tau} \eta_{l,\tau'} \rangle \, d\tau \, d\tau'.
\]

The noise term \(\langle \eta_{k,\tau} \eta_{l,\tau'} \rangle\) satisfies:
\[
\langle \eta_{k,\tau} \eta_{l,\tau'} \rangle = \delta_{kl} \delta(\tau - \tau'),
\]
which simplifies the double integral:
\[
\langle Q_i(t) Q_j(s) \rangle = \int_{-\infty}^{\min(t,s)} e^{-\lambda_i (t - \tau)} e^{-\lambda_j (s - \tau)} \sum_k (U_{ki}^\top B_{kk} U_{kj}^\top B_{kk}) \, d\tau.
\]

Factor out the exponential terms:
\[
\langle Q_i(t) Q_j(s) \rangle = \sum_k (U_{ki}^\top B_{kk}) (U_{kj}^\top B_{kk}) \int_{-\infty}^{\min(t,s)} e^{-\lambda_i (t - \tau)} e^{-\lambda_j (s - \tau)} \, d\tau.
\]

Simplify the exponential combination:
\[
e^{-\lambda_i (t - \tau)} e^{-\lambda_j (s - \tau)} = e^{-(\lambda_i t + \lambda_j s)} e^{(\lambda_i + \lambda_j) \tau}.
\]

The integral becomes:
\[
\int_{-\infty}^{\min(t,s)} e^{-(\lambda_i t + \lambda_j s)} e^{(\lambda_i + \lambda_j) \tau} \, d\tau.
\]

Evaluating the integral:
\[
\int_{-\infty}^{\min(t,s)} e^{-(\lambda_i t + \lambda_j s)} e^{(\lambda_i + \lambda_j) \tau} \, d\tau = \frac{e^{-(\lambda_i t + \lambda_j s)}}{\lambda_i + \lambda_j} \left[ e^{(\lambda_i + \lambda_j) \min(t,s)} \right].
\]

Substitute back:
\[
\langle Q_i(t) Q_j(s) \rangle = \sum_k \frac{(U_{ki}^\top B_{kk}) (U_{kj}^\top B_{kk})}{\lambda_i + \lambda_j} e^{-\lambda_i t - \lambda_j s} \left( e^{(\lambda_i + \lambda_j) \min(t,s)} \right).
\]

Simplify further:
\[
\langle Q_i(t) Q_j(s) \rangle = \sum_k \frac{(U_{ki}^\top B_{kk}) (U_{kj}^\top B_{kk})}{\lambda_i + \lambda_j} e^{-\lambda_i |t-s|}.
\]

So:
\[
\langle X_i(t) X_j^\top(s) \rangle = \sum_k \sum_p \sum_m \frac{U_{ik} U_{jp} (U_{mk}^\top B_{mm}^2 U_{mp}^\top)}{\lambda_k + \lambda_p} e^{-\lambda_k |t-s|}.
\]

The formula describes the temporal correlation between the components \( X_i(t) \) and \( X_j(s) \) in a stochastic system under the influence of noise. Each term in the formula has a specific role:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Coupling through Eigenvectors (\( U_{ik} \) and \( U_{jp} \)):}
    These terms project the system's dynamics into the eigenbasis of the matrix \( \mathbf{K} \), capturing how the eigenmodes contribute to the observed correlations between \( i \) and \( j \).

    \item \textbf{Noise Contribution (\( B_{mm}^2 \)):}
    The diagonal matrix \( B_{mm}^2 \) introduces temperature-dependent scaling of the stochastic noise. This reflects the local intensity of fluctuations at mode \( m \).

    \item \textbf{Cross-mode Interaction (\( U_{mk}^\top B_{mm}^2 U_{mp}^\top \)):}
    The product of \( U_{mk}^\top \) and \( U_{mp}^\top \) determines how noise from mode \( m \) couples different eigenmodes \( k \) and \( p \), weighted by the structure of the eigenvectors.

    \item \textbf{Exponential Decay (\( e^{-\lambda_k |t-s|} \)):}
    The term \( e^{-\lambda_k |t-s|} \) encapsulates the temporal decay of the correlation, governed by the eigenvalue \( \lambda_k \). Larger eigenvalues correspond to faster decay, indicating less persistent correlations over time.

    \item \textbf{Denominator (\( \lambda_k + \lambda_p \)):}
    The denominator ensures that the contributions from eigenmodes are properly weighted by their respective damping rates \( \lambda_k \) and \( \lambda_p \), balancing the dynamic interactions between modes.
\end{itemize}

As before the transfer entropy it is completely determined by the correlation.

\section{Temperature determination}
In this study, we introduce a novel approach to investigate protein dynamics by setting two distinct temperature regimes. One temperature is fixed at \( T = 1 \), representing a high-energy state, while the other temperature varies between \( T = 0 \) and \( T = 1 \) for each experiment. This configuration allows us to drive the system out of equilibrium and study the allosteric behavior under non-equilibrium conditions.

The temperature assigned to a given residue is determined based on its connectivity within the protein structure. Specifically, if a residue has five or more connections, it is assigned a temperature of \( T^* \) (varying temperature); otherwise, it is assigned \( T = 0 \). This methodology links the temperature directly to the residue's position and role within the protein network.

Residues located near the center of the protein typically exhibit a higher number of connections due to their central role in maintaining structural integrity. These residues tend to fluctuate less and are therefore associated with lower effective temperatures. Conversely, residues with fewer connections, often found on the periphery, are more flexible and are assigned higher temperatures.

By combining fixed and variable temperature conditions, this approach enables a deeper understanding of the relationship between protein topology, residue connectivity, and dynamic behavior under non-equilibrium states. The differential temperature settings also provide a framework to explore how structural positions influence allosteric signaling and energy distribution across the protein.

        \item These residues are more constrained dynamically and are therefore associated with lower temperatures (\(T = 0\)), as reflected in the graph.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Alpha Helix Regions:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Alpha helix regions (e.g., around residue 76) typically exhibit intermediate levels of connectivity. However, their intrinsic flexibility and less rigid packing compared to beta sheets allow for more dynamic motion.
        \item As a result, residues in these regions are more likely to be assigned the variable temperature \(T^* = 1\), reflecting their increased flexibility.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Peripheral or Loop Regions:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Residues located in loops or on the protein's surface (e.g., around residues 40 and 60) generally have fewer connections, as these regions are more exposed and less structurally integrated.
        \item This lower connectivity results in higher assigned temperatures (\(T^* = 1\)), indicating greater dynamic motion and adaptability in these regions.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Transitions Between Structural Elements:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The abrupt changes in temperature assignments visible in the graph correspond to transitions between secondary structural elements, such as from beta sheets to loops or from helices to sheets.
        \item These transitions highlight local differences in residue connectivity and dynamic behavior dictated by the structural topology.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Correlation Matrix}
\noindent For the connection radius and for the Kirchhoff matrix are valid the precedence arguments respectively in sections \ref{connection_radius} and \ref{Kirchhoff_paragraph}.\\
The two figures illustrate the correlation matrices obtained from the protein structure. The elements of the matrix represent correlations between residues \(i\) and \(j\), derived from the dynamics and structure of the system. Overlaying the secondary structure (Helices: red; Beta Sheets: blue) helps to contextualize the correlations within structural motifs. The Kirchhoff matrix was used to compute these correlations.

\section{Beta Factors}
\noindent The plot above compares the experimental \( B \)-factors (blue curve), as we said in \eqref{beta} $B_i = 8\pi^2 C_{ii}$, with the predicted \( B \)-factors (red curve) along the residue index. The \( B \)-factors, which represent the atomic displacement or flexibility, are a critical measure of the dynamic behavior of the protein structure.
\paragraph{Analysis:}

Using formula of section \ref{sec:Evaluation}, we can evaluate the model performance by calculating the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) between the predicted and experimental \( B \)-factors. 
These metrics provide a quantitative assessment of the model's accuracy in capturing the protein's dynamic behavior.

        $T=0.5$ & 5.945765531711077 & 8.000476544489148 \\ \hline

\end{figure}


The results showcase how varying the applied temperature difference (\(\Delta T\)) affects the predictive accuracy of \( B \)-factors, which represent atomic displacement or flexibility of residues in the protein structure. By analyzing \(\Delta T = 1\) and \(\Delta T = 0.5\), we observe that the system driven out of equilibrium (\(\Delta T = 1\)) exhibits more predictable dynamics, resulting in lower error metrics and better alignment between predicted and experimental \( B \)-factors. Below is a detailed discussion of the results and their implications.

\subsection{Quantitative Results: Error Metrics}
The performance of the model is evaluated using MAE (Mean Absolute Error) and RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error):
\begin{itemize}
    \item For \(\Delta T = 1\):
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{MAE}: 5.6776
        \item \textbf{RMSE}: 7.6349
    \end{itemize}
    These relatively low values indicate that the model performs better at higher temperature gradients. The system, being farther from equilibrium, exhibits more pronounced patterns of flexibility, making it easier for the model to align the predicted \( B \)-factors with the experimental values.
    \item For \(\Delta T = 0.5\):
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{MAE}: 5.9458
        \item \textbf{RMSE}: 8.0005
    \end{itemize}
    The higher error metrics suggest that the system closer to equilibrium exhibits subtler or more stochastic flexibility patterns, which are harder for the model to predict accurately.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Graphical Interpretation}
\textbf{Top Plot: Comparison of Experimental and Predicted \( B \)-Factors}\\
The blue curve represents the experimental \( B \)-factors, and the red curve represents the predicted values:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{For \(\Delta T = 1\)}: The predicted \( B \)-factors align closely with the experimental values across much of the residue index, suggesting that the system's response to a larger temperature gradient is more structured and predictable.
    \item \textbf{For \(\Delta T = 0.5\)}: There are noticeable deviations, particularly in regions with sharp peaks or valleys. This indicates that closer-to-equilibrium conditions result in more complex and localized flexibility patterns, which the model struggles to capture.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Bottom Plot: Temperature Variations Across Residues}\\
The second plot visualizes how different temperature gradients (\(\Delta T\)) influence residue dynamics:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Higher \(\Delta T\)}: Amplifies the non-equilibrium effects, leading to larger structural displacements and more pronounced flexibility patterns.
    \item \textbf{Lower \(\Delta T\)}: Reflects a system closer to equilibrium, where dynamic flexibility is subtler and dominated by local stochastic fluctuations.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Implications of Non-Equilibrium Dynamics}
The results suggest that driving the system out of equilibrium (\(\Delta T = 1\)) creates conditions that are easier to model:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Non-Equilibrium as a Stabilizing Factor}: Larger \(\Delta T\) introduces structured, large-scale patterns of atomic displacement, which are easier to predict as they follow more deterministic trends caused by the temperature gradient. This is reflected in the lower MAE and RMSE values.
    \item \textbf{Closer to Equilibrium (\(\Delta T = 0.5\))}: At smaller temperature gradients, the system exhibits subtler patterns of flexibility driven by stochastic fluctuations. These are inherently more difficult to model, resulting in higher errors.
\end{itemize}



\subsection{Broader Implications for Protein Dynamics}
These findings highlight an important principle: \textit{systems driven out of equilibrium exhibit more structured and predictable behavior}. This has several implications:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Dynamic Stability}: Non-equilibrium conditions (higher \(\Delta T\)) induce large-scale flexibility patterns, which are easier for computational models to capture.
    \item \textbf{Model Calibration}: Models may require different calibration strategies for equilibrium (\(\Delta T = 0.5\)) versus non-equilibrium (\(\Delta T = 1\)) conditions.
    \item \textbf{Experimental Design}: Non-equilibrium conditions could reveal broader structural dynamics, while equilibrium conditions may emphasize localized effects.
\end{itemize}

\end{figure}
\subsection{Cross-Correlation: Forward and Backward Dynamics}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Peak Behavior:} Both forward and backward correlations exhibit distinct peaks around \(t = 0\), indicating strong interactions at this specific time lag. The strongest correlation is observed for residue pairs (21, 76) and (21, 39), with a more pronounced forward correlation compared to backward correlation.
    \item \textbf{Asymmetric Dynamics:} Forward correlations (e.g., (21, 76)) are generally higher and exhibit sharper peaks than backward correlations, highlighting directional dependencies between residues. Backward correlations are smoother and less pronounced, suggesting weaker reverse interactions.
    \item \textbf{Residue-Specific Effects:} Residue pair (21, 22) shows the smallest cross-correlation values, indicating less significant dynamic coupling compared to the other pairs.
\end{itemize}

    \caption{Transfer entropy in time $\Delta T = 1$.}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Transfer Entropy: Forward and Backward Dynamics}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Directional Influence:} Transfer entropy captures a clear forward bias, with forward interactions (e.g., (21, 76) and (21, 39)) showing significantly higher values compared to their backward counterparts. Peaks around \(t = 0\) are sharper and more localized than in cross-correlation, emphasizing the information-theoretic directional influence.
    \item \textbf{Temporal Symmetry:} Forward transfer entropy decays rapidly after \(t > 0\), while backward transfer entropy remains negligible, reinforcing the idea of unidirectional information transfer.
    \item \textbf{Residue Pair Hierarchy:} Pairs (21, 76) and (21, 39) exhibit the strongest transfer entropy, with (21, 76) having the highest peak. Residue pair (21, 22) again shows minimal transfer entropy, consistent with its weaker interaction.
\end{itemize}






\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Forward Dominance:} Both cross-correlation and transfer entropy highlight the dominance of forward dynamics over backward dynamics, reflecting stronger causal influences in the forward direction.
    \item \textbf{Residue Pair Importance:} Residue pairs (21, 76) and (21, 39) are central to the dynamic interactions, while (21, 22) shows a marginal role.
    \item \textbf{Quantitative Comparison:} Transfer entropy provides a more refined and directional measure of interaction, while cross-correlation gives a broader view of dynamic coupling.
\end{itemize}

\section{Causal indicators between residues}
\subsection{characteristic time determination}
To analyze our system, it is essential to focus on timescales around the \textit{characteristic time} \(\tau\). 
If the time \(t\) is too small, the dynamics of the system cannot be observed effectively. Conversely, if \(t\) is too large, the relaxation behavior of the system becomes indistinguishable.

We can determine the characteristic time \(\tau\) of the system using the following algorithm:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Compute the autocorrelation function \(C_{i,i}(t)\) for all available times \(t\).
    \item Identify, for each \(i\), the time \(t_i\) such that 
    \[
    C_{i,i}(t_i) = e^{-1} C_{i,i}(0),
    \]
    where \(C_{i,i}(0)\) represents the initial autocorrelation value.
    \item Calculate the mean of all \(t_i\). This mean value represents the characteristic time \(\tau\) of the system:
    \[
    \tau = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} t_i.
    \]
\end{enumerate}

We estimated a \(\tau\) of 0.1869 ns.
All the following analysis will be done around the characteristic time \(\tau\), specifically at [\(\tau\)-0.5*\(\tau\),\(\tau\),\(\tau\)+0.5*\(\tau\)].

\subsection{Correlation between residues}
\noindent The dynamic interplay between the beta sheet and the helix is quantitatively evident across all figures. The beta sheet stabilizes the protein through localized rigidity and strong intra-regional dynamics, while the helix introduces flexibility and facilitates long-range communication. These complementary roles are essential for balancing the stability and functional adaptability of the protein structure.

    \label{fig:corr76_out}
\end{figure}
\subsubsection{Graphic Analysis of Response}

\paragraph{Figure \ref{fig:corr21_out}: Correlation and Temperature for Residue 76}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{High Temperature Dynamics:} At higher temperatures (e.g., \( T = 1.0 \)), the correlation pattern is broader and more dispersed, indicating increased flexibility and global communication across residues.
    \item \textbf{Low Temperature Dynamics:} At lower temperatures (\( T = 0.0 \)), the correlation profile becomes sharper and more localized, reflecting more constrained structural dynamics.
    \item \textbf{Residual Influence:} The correlation gradually decreases as the residue index moves away from 76, highlighting the diminishing dynamic influence of this residue on others.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Figure \ref{fig:corr76_out}: Correlation and Temperature for Residue 21}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{High Temperature Dynamics:} Similar to residue 76, high temperatures (\( T = 1.0 \)) result in a broader and more uniform correlation distribution.
    \item \textbf{Low Temperature Dynamics:} At lower temperatures (\( T = 0.0 \)), the correlation is more localized, indicating reduced flexibility and tighter coupling between residues.
    \item \textbf{Relative Influence:} The peak correlation values for residue 21 are slightly lower than those for residue 76, suggesting that residue 76 has a higher dynamic centrality in the structure.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Temperature Variation and General Observations}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Temperature Oscillations:} Both figures show regular oscillations in temperature, reflecting dynamic structural changes in the protein.
    \item \textbf{Flexibility vs. Rigidity:} High temperatures (\( T = 1.0 \)) are associated with broader fluctuations and more dispersed correlation effects, while low temperatures (\( T = 0.0 \)) correspond to sharp, localized peaks, indicating more rigid and limited dynamic behavior.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Conclusions}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The temperature significantly affects the flexibility and dynamics of residue correlations.
    \item Residues 76 and 21 represent dynamically significant points in the protein structure, with residue 76 showing greater dynamic influence overall.
    \item These results suggest that thermal regulation could be a critical mechanism for modulating the structural and functional dynamics of the protein.

\subsection{Conclusion}
The analysis reveals that driving the system out of equilibrium (\(\Delta T = 1\)) results in lower MAE and RMSE values and better alignment between predicted and experimental \( B \)-factors. Non-equilibrium conditions create more structured and predictable dynamics, while closer-to-equilibrium systems (\(\Delta T = 0.5\)) exhibit subtler and more stochastic flexibility patterns. These findings underscore the stabilizing effect of non-equilibrium conditions on protein dynamics and highlight the critical role of temperature gradients in studying and modeling protein flexibility.
















\chapter{Introduction}
The aim of this thesis is to analyze the entropy rate of a stochastic process driven by a Langevin dynamic equation. Using a Kirchhoff matrix derived from structural data, we simulate the dynamics of a system and compare the theoretical entropy rate with experimental results from numerical simulations. The foundational concepts and methods follow the approach described in the referenced article. Discrepancies between theory and experiment are explored to refine the model.

\chapter{Mathematical Framework}

\section{Langevin Dynamics}
The system evolves according to the Langevin equation:
\begin{equation}
\frac{d\mathbf{X}_t}{dt} = \mathbf{A} \mathbf{X}_t + \mathbf{B} \boldsymbol{\eta}_t,
\end{equation}
where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( \mathbf{X}_t \): The state vector of the system at time \( t \),
    \item \( \mathbf{A} = -\frac{\mathbf{K}}{\gamma} \): System matrix derived from the Kirchhoff matrix \( \mathbf{K} \) and the friction coefficient \( \gamma \),
    \item \( \mathbf{B} \): Noise matrix, encoding the effect of thermal fluctuations,
    \item \( \boldsymbol{\eta}_t \): Gaussian white noise with zero mean and unit variance.
\end{itemize}
The noise term satisfies the fluctuation-dissipation theorem:
\begin{equation}
\langle \boldsymbol{\eta}_t \boldsymbol{\eta}_{t'}^T \rangle = \delta(t - t') \mathbf{I},
\end{equation}
where \( \mathbf{I} \) is the identity matrix.

\section{Covariance Dynamics}
Let \( \mathbf{\Sigma} \) be the covariance matrix of \( \mathbf{X}_t \):
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{\Sigma} = \langle \mathbf{X}_t \mathbf{X}_t^T \rangle.
\end{equation}
Differentiating \( \mathbf{\Sigma} \) with respect to time and using the Langevin equation, we get:
\begin{align}
\frac{d\mathbf{\Sigma}}{dt} &= \langle \frac{d\mathbf{X}_t}{dt} \mathbf{X}_t^T \rangle + \langle \mathbf{X}_t \frac{d\mathbf{X}_t^T}{dt} \rangle \\
&= \mathbf{A} \mathbf{\Sigma} + \mathbf{\Sigma} \mathbf{A}^T + \mathbf{B} \mathbf{B}^T.
\end{align}
At equilibrium, \( \frac{d\mathbf{\Sigma}}{dt} = 0 \), leading to the Lyapunov equation:
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{A} \mathbf{\Sigma} + \mathbf{\Sigma} \mathbf{A}^T + \mathbf{B} \mathbf{B}^T = 0.
\end{equation}

\section{Entropy Rate Derivation}
The entropy rate for a Gaussian process is given by:
\begin{equation}
\dot{S} = \frac{1}{2} \text{Tr}\left( \mathbf{A}^T \mathbf{\Sigma}^{-1} \mathbf{A} \mathbf{\Sigma} + \mathbf{\Sigma}^{-1} \mathbf{B} \mathbf{B}^T \right) - \frac{1}{2} \text{Tr}(\mathbf{A}).
\end{equation}
This formula arises from the differential entropy of a Gaussian distribution and the dynamics of the covariance matrix. Each term corresponds to:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( \text{Tr}(\mathbf{A}^T \mathbf{\Sigma}^{-1} \mathbf{A} \mathbf{\Sigma}) \): Contribution from deterministic dynamics,
    \item \( \text{Tr}(\mathbf{\Sigma}^{-1} \mathbf{B} \mathbf{B}^T) \): Contribution from stochastic noise,
    \item \( \text{Tr}(\mathbf{A}) \): Dissipation.
\end{itemize}

\chapter{Methods}

\section{Simulation Setup}
The Kirchhoff matrix \( \mathbf{K} \) is constructed to represent residue interactions in a biological structure. Thermal fluctuations are incorporated through a position-dependent noise matrix \( \mathbf{B} \). The Langevin dynamics are simulated using the Euler-Maruyama method with parameters:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( \gamma = 1 \), friction coefficient,
    \item \( k_B = 1 \), Boltzmann constant,
    \item \( dt = 0.0005 \), time step,
    \item \( T = 1000 \), total simulation time.
\end{itemize}

\section{Numerical Implementation}
The system evolution is calculated iteratively:
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{X}_{t+1} = \mathbf{X}_t + dt \cdot \mathbf{A} \mathbf{X}_t + \mathbf{B} \boldsymbol{\eta}_t,
\end{equation}
where \( \boldsymbol{\eta}_t \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sqrt{dt}) \).

\chapter{Results}

\section{Entropy Rate}
The theoretical and experimental entropy rates are compared. The experimental entropy rate is estimated using the covariance of increments:
\begin{equation}
\dot{S}_{\text{experimental}} = \frac{1}{2} \text{Tr}\left( \mathbf{\Sigma}^{-1} \mathbf{\Sigma}_{\Delta t} \right),
\end{equation}
where \( \mathbf{\Sigma}_{\Delta t} \) is the covariance of the increments \( \Delta \mathbf{X} \).

\section{Equilibrium Distribution}
The equilibrium distribution of the first residue \( X[0] \) is visualized to confirm stationarity:
\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{equilibrium_distribution.png}
    \caption{Equilibrium distribution of \( X[0] \).}
    \label{fig:equilibrium}
\end{figure}

\chapter{Discussion}

\section{Discrepancies}
Theoretical entropy rates are higher than experimental values due to potential numerical instabilities in the covariance inversion or incorrect scaling of noise terms.

\section{Refinements}
Future improvements include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Improved conditioning of \( \mathbf{\Sigma} \),
    \item Verification of \( \mathbf{B} \)'s scaling against physical parameters,
    \item Larger time steps and longer simulations for better sampling.
\end{itemize}

\chapter{Conclusion}
This work highlights the importance of numerical stability in entropy rate estimation for stochastic processes. The presented framework provides a foundation for further exploration of Langevin dynamics in complex systems.












\section*{Model Definition}
The stochastic process under consideration is described by the differential equation:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:stochastic}
\frac{dx_i}{dt} = -K x_i + \epsilon \cdot (1 - \cos(\omega t))(\delta_{i,a} - \delta_{i,b}) + \eta(t),
\end{equation}
where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $x_i$ represents the relative position of each residue;
    \item $K$ is the Kirchhoff matrix, which governs the interactions between residues;
    \item $\epsilon$ is a parameter describing the intensity of the oscillatory term;
    \item $\omega$ is the angular frequency of the oscillation;
    \item $\delta_{i,a}$ and $\delta_{i,b}$ are Kronecker delta functions that select specific residues $a$ and $b$;
    \item $\eta(t)$ represents a stochastic term describing white noise.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Interpretation of the Terms}
The equation \eqref{eq:stochastic} can be interpreted as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Dissipative Term:} $-K x_i$ represents the dissipative force proportional to the position $x_i$, with the matrix $K$ characterizing the interactions between residues.
    \item \textbf{Oscillatory Term:} $\epsilon \cdot (1 - \cos(\omega t))(\delta_{i,a} - \delta_{i,b})$ introduces a periodic acceleration between residues $a$ and $b$ with an amplitude modulated by the function $1 - \cos(\omega t)$.
    \item \textbf{Stochastic Term:} $\eta(t)$ represents the contribution of white noise, often modeled as a Gaussian process with zero mean and constant variance $\sigma^2$.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Formal Solution}
To solve equation \eqref{eq:stochastic}, we can separate the deterministic and stochastic contributions. The solution is written as the sum:
\begin{equation}
    x_i(t) = x_i^{(d)}(t) + x_i^{(s)}(t),
\end{equation}
where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $x_i^{(d)}(t)$ is the solution of the deterministic part;
    \item $x_i^{(s)}(t)$ is the solution of the stochastic part.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Deterministic Solution}
The deterministic part of the equation is:
\begin{equation}
    \frac{dx_i^{(d)}}{dt} = -K x_i^{(d)} + \epsilon \cdot (1 - \cos(\omega t))(\delta_{i,a} - \delta_{i,b}).
\end{equation}
The general solution can be written as:
\begin{equation}
    x_i^{(d)}(t) = e^{-Kt} x_i^{(d)}(0) + \int_0^t e^{-K(t-s)} \epsilon \cdot (1 - \cos(\omega s))(\delta_{i,a} - \delta_{i,b}) ds.
\end{equation}

\subsection*{Stochastic Solution}
The stochastic part is governed by the equation:
\begin{equation}
    \frac{dx_i^{(s)}}{dt} = \eta(t).
\end{equation}
Assuming $\eta(t)$ is a Gaussian process, direct integration gives:
\begin{equation}
    x_i^{(s)}(t) = \int_0^t \eta(s) ds,
\end{equation}
where $x_i^{(s)}(t)$ is a Wiener process.

\section*{Kirchhoff Matrix}
The matrix $K$ is defined as:
\begin{equation}
    K_{ij} = \begin{cases}
        -k_{ij} & \text{if } i \neq j, \\
        \sum_{k \neq i} k_{ik} & \text{if } i = j.
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}
This structure ensures that the matrix $K$ has non-negative eigenvalues, with one zero corresponding to the center of mass motion.







\section*{Conclusions}
Equation \eqref{eq:stochastic} describes a complex system combining dissipation, oscillations, and stochastic noise. The analysis of its properties strongly depends on the structure of the matrix $K$, the frequency $\omega$, and the intensity of the noise $\eta(t)$. The formal solution presented can serve as a starting point for further numerical or perturbative analyses.
\section*{Model Definition}
The stochastic process under consideration is described by the differential equation:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:stochastic}
\frac{dx_i}{dt} = -K x_i + \epsilon \cdot (1 - \cos(\omega t))(\delta_{i,a} - \delta_{i,b}) + \eta_i(t),
\end{equation}
where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $x_i$ represents the relative position of each residue;
    \item $K$ is the Kirchhoff matrix, which governs the interactions between residues;
    \item $\epsilon$ is a parameter describing the intensity of the oscillatory term;
    \item $\omega$ is the angular frequency of the oscillation;
    \item $\delta_{i,a}$ and $\delta_{i,b}$ are Kronecker delta functions that select specific residues $a$ and $b$;
    \item $\eta_i(t)$ represents a stochastic term describing white noise.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Reformulation in Terms of Eigenvectors}
The Kirchhoff matrix $K$ can be diagonalized as:
\begin{equation}
K = V \Lambda V^{-1},
\end{equation}
where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $V$ is the matrix whose columns are the eigenvectors of $K$;
    \item $\Lambda$ is a diagonal matrix containing the eigenvalues of $K$.
\end{itemize}
Substituting $x_i = V y$ into equation \eqref{eq:stochastic}, we get:
\begin{equation}
\frac{d}{dt}(V y) = -V \Lambda V^{-1}(V y) + \epsilon \cdot (1 - \cos(\omega t))(\delta_{i,a} - \delta_{i,b}) + \eta_i(t).
\end{equation}
Multiplying through by $V^{-1}$, we obtain:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:projected}
\frac{dy}{dt} = -\Lambda y + V^{-1} \left[ \epsilon \cdot (1 - \cos(\omega t))(\delta_{i,a} - \delta_{i,b}) + \eta_i(t) \right].
\end{equation}

\section*{Component-Wise Expansion}
Expanding equation \eqref{eq:projected} for each component $y_k$ (corresponding to the $k$-th eigenvalue $\lambda_k$), we get:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:yk}
\frac{dy_k}{dt} = -\lambda_k y_k + \epsilon \cdot (1 - \cos(\omega t)) \langle v_k, (\delta_{i,a} - \delta_{i,b}) \rangle + \langle v_k, \eta_i(t) \rangle,
\end{equation}
where $v_k$ is the $k$-th eigenvector of $K$, and:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\langle v_k, (\delta_{i,a} - \delta_{i,b}) \rangle = v_k(a) - v_k(b)$;
    \item $\langle v_k, \eta_i(t) \rangle = \sum_i v_k(i) \eta_i(t)$.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Simplification of Terms}
Using the Kronecker delta property:
\begin{equation}
\langle v_k, (\delta_{i,a} - \delta_{i,b}) \rangle = v_k(a) - v_k(b),
\end{equation}
and defining:
\begin{equation}
\eta_k(t) = \langle v_k, \eta_i(t) \rangle = \sum_i v_k(i) \eta_i(t),
\end{equation}
equation \eqref{eq:yk} simplifies to:
\begin{equation}
\frac{dy_k}{dt} = -\lambda_k y_k + \epsilon \cdot (1 - \cos(\omega t))(v_k(a) - v_k(b)) + \eta_k(t).
\end{equation}

\section*{Formal Solution}
The solution for each $y_k(t)$ is given by:
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
    y_k(t) &= y_k(0) e^{-\lambda_k t} + \int_0^t e^{-\lambda_k (t-s)} \left[ \epsilon \cdot (1 - \cos(\omega s))(v_k(a) - v_k(b)) + \eta_k(s) \right] ds.
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

\subsection*{Explicit Calculation of the Oscillatory Term}
We compute the oscillatory integral:
\begin{equation}
I = \int_0^t e^{-\lambda_k (t-s)} \cos(\omega s) \, ds.
\end{equation}
Using substitution and trigonometric identities, we find:
\begin{equation}
I = \cos(\omega t) \left( \frac{e^{-\lambda_k t} (\lambda_k \cos(\omega t) + \omega \sin(\omega t))}{\lambda_k^2 + \omega^2} - \frac{\lambda_k}{\lambda_k^2 + \omega^2} \right) + \sin(\omega t) \frac{e^{-\lambda_k t} (\omega \cos(\omega t) - \lambda_k \sin(\omega t))}{\lambda_k^2 + \omega^2}.
\end{equation}
This result provides the explicit form of the oscillatory term in terms of $\omega$ and $\lambda_k$.

\section*{Reconstruction of $x_i(t)$}
To reconstruct $x_i(t)$ in the original space, we combine the contributions from all eigenvectors:
\begin{equation}
    x_i(t) = \sum_{k=1}^n v_k y_k(t).
\end{equation}
\section*{Correlation Function}
The correlation function for $x_i(t)$ and $x_j(s)$ is given by:
\begin{equation}
\langle x_i(t)x_j(s) \rangle = \sum_{k,q} V_{ik} V_{jq} \langle y_k(t)y_q(s) \rangle,
\end{equation}
where $V_{ik}$ are the components of the eigenvectors of the Kirchhoff matrix $K$, and $y_k(t)$ represents the $k$-th mode in the eigenvector basis.

\subsection*{Correlation of $y_k(t)$ and $y_q(s)$}
The correlation of $y_k(t)$ and $y_q(s)$ includes contributions from:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The initial conditions;
    \item The oscillatory term;
    \item The stochastic noise term.
\end{itemize}
We write:
\begin{equation}
\langle y_k(t)y_q(s) \rangle = \underbrace{\langle y_k(0)y_q(0) \rangle e^{-\lambda_k t} e^{-\lambda_q s}}_{\text{Initial condition term}} + \underbrace{\langle I_k(t) I_q(s) \rangle}_{\text{Oscillatory term}} + \underbrace{\langle N_k(t) N_q(s) \rangle}_{\text{Noise term}},
\end{equation}
where $I_k(t)$ represents the oscillatory contribution and $N_k(t)$ the stochastic noise.

\subsection*{Oscillatory Term}
The oscillatory term is given by:
\begin{equation}
I_k(t) = \epsilon (v_k(a) - v_k(b)) \left[ \frac{1 - e^{-\lambda_k t}}{\lambda_k} - \left( \frac{\lambda_k \cos(\omega t) + \omega \sin(\omega t)}{\lambda_k^2 + \omega^2} e^{-\lambda_k t} - \frac{\lambda_k}{\lambda_k^2 + \omega^2} \right) \right].
\end{equation}
For the correlation of $I_k(t)$ and $I_q(s)$, we focus on the dominant case $k = q$:
\begin{equation}
\langle I_k(t) I_k(s) \rangle = \epsilon^2 (v_k(a) - v_k(b))^2 \langle J_k(t) J_k(s) \rangle,
\end{equation}
where:
\begin{equation}
J_k(t) = \int_0^t e^{-\lambda_k (t-\tau)} (1 - \cos(\omega \tau)) \, d\tau.
\end{equation}

Expanding $J_k(t)$:
\begin{equation}
J_k(t) = \frac{1}{\lambda_k} - \frac{\lambda_k}{\lambda_k^2 + \omega^2} - e^{-\lambda_k t} \left[ \frac{1}{\lambda_k} - \frac{\lambda_k \cos(\omega t) + \omega \sin(\omega t)}{\lambda_k^2 + \omega^2} \right].
\end{equation}

The oscillatory correlation is then:
\begin{equation}
\langle I_k(t) I_k(s) \rangle = \epsilon^2 (v_k(a) - v_k(b))^2 \frac{\cos(\omega t) \cos(\omega s) + \sin(\omega t) \sin(\omega s)}{\lambda_k^2 + \omega^2} e^{-\lambda_k (t+s)}.
\end{equation}

\subsection*{Final Correlation Function}
Combining the oscillatory contribution with the full expression for $\langle y_k(t)y_q(s) \rangle$, the correlation function becomes:
\begin{equation}
\langle x_i(t)x_j(s) \rangle = \sum_k V_{ik} V_{jk} \left[ \frac{C_k}{\lambda_k^2} e^{-\lambda_k(t+s)} + \epsilon^2 \frac{(v_k(a) - v_k(b))^2}{\lambda_k^2 + \omega^2} \cos(\omega t - \omega s) e^{-\lambda_k (t+s)} \right].
\end{equation}
Here, $C_k$ depends on the initial conditions, while the second term explicitly includes the oscillatory contribution.
